I don't see how coming from another country makes them any less human.
In addition to providing labour and contributing to the local economy, migrants are often employing people who were previously on the dole.
In my opinion, the only sickness you have is the allergy to the word 'mosque'
Society often forces women to be submissive to their husbands. But this is a social construct based on false beliefs.
They're not fake: they're just coming here to work, study or provide for their families.
Migration is a natural and healthy process. It is not a crime to have the desire to emigrate. We can talk about immigration levels, but we should not make the mistake of equating immigration with invasion.
Do you really want to tell people fleeing from war what to do? If you can't cope in the short term, what hope do we have for the future?
Feminists believe in equality of rights. They believe that men and women are created equal, and that men and women can have equal rights.
Why would you think it is a war? Can't we deal with it peacefully? War cannot solve problems but create chaos.
Muslims have the right to practice what they want, as long as they are not forcing others to live their way.
Jews are people too, regardless of religion, and they are welcome here, as anyone is allowed to be a part of our society.
I don't understand why you would think they are disgusting. It's not fair to have homophobic feelings, and I think it's better to try to be nice to anyone.
There exist a war with fundamentalists, not Islam. The followers of Islam do not promote violence and they are interested in peaceful coexistence in the world.
There is nothing wrong with women wanting to have happy and fulfilling lives, wherever they may be.
Violent people are not always Muslim, and violent Muslims exist just as violent Christians do.
What exactly are you talking about? Maybe you should stop spread racism.
It doesn't have to be about the domination of women to be feminism. It is more about the equality of women.
Feminists promote equality, and I don't see how equality between men and women would be called a 'problem'. Why do you?
They were smart enough understand the true nature of Nazi Germany. Those you called idiots fought with their whole lives for people's freedom.
How can you say something as crude and meaningless as that about a religion? Isn't it just a personal belief everyone should have the right to profess?
Why do you think it would bring back slavery and oppression? What exactly is the connection between the marriage of homosexual people and the oppression you are talking about?
Jews are people that follow the Jewish faith, and Jewish people took part in our history. How can you deny that?
Why would they? They, like anybody, have the freedom to choose their own religion. This does not mean they want to erase other religions though.
So you think that killing people is the reason for Islam? Can you point me the passage of the Qu'ran where this is mentioned?
Migrants are welcome here, regardless of their origin.
I feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech.
Do you really think that racism instead is healthy in the 21st century? It's not healthy for children to learn discrimination and hate.
The Koran does not tolerate violence, peace is a part of the faith and for this it should be tolerated.
In this day and age when many people recognize themselves in minorities, it is important that we all show some respect for what is different about each other's cultures.
Many immigrants started their own companies: this is not 'stealing our jobs'.
If women want to control their fertility they have the right to do it, because they are free to make choices for their own lives.
Being soft and emotional is not a bad thing in itself. And it is not an attribute of only women.
This is an attack on a specific community. If you consider them incompatible with modern culture, it is very likely that the incompatibility comes out of a racist branch of modern culture.
You have an impression. Many Jews operate in this field of finance, TV and so on, but that doesn't mean that they control it.
The solution to Islamophobia is to stop Islamophobia. It is not to ban Muslims.
Women are obliged to obey the laws and rules of society, just as men are obliged to obey the laws and rules of society. Not to their partners'.
You are being cruel. You are accusing Muslims of harboring rape fantasies. This is not how Muslims in the UK think.
We are all guilty of this if we fail to condemn hate.
There is no evidence that women are less smart than men, and there is evidence that women are often disadvantaged. To suggest otherwise is just a form of sexism.
We have never done that. We believe that all people are created equal in rights, no matter their physical or mental health.
Why do so many British people associate Muslims with rape? Islam is about sharing values, tolerance and understanding. It is not about sharing non-consensual sex.
There are many good reasons for migrating: to work, escape poverty, etc. Would you hate someone for any of these reasons?
Violence is a crime and anyone found guilty will pay the price.
You seem to be confused about the definition of a 'civilised society'. How are you going to manage a society where so many people would be excluded just because of their sexuality?
Luckily, the vast majority of women, both married and unmarried, have careers. Their husbands usually contribute part of the housework, because this is what they are supposed to do too.
Do you understand the seriousness of what you are saying? The religion of Islam has also been an enabler of some of the advances of civilisation.
Silliness is not a bad thing if you know how to present it with a sense of humor. But this seems like nonsense to stir the pot with racist narrative.
How exactly do you define "ugly skin"?
Please stop using ableist slurs. It's not funny to be offensive to people suffering from disabilities.
Why should we consider them incompatible? Are you implying that peaceful coexistence in a society can be based on the exclusion of others?
The British people have always had a proud and integrated culture, and immigration have been and continues to be a huge part of the British success story.
That is not what feminism is about. Feminism is about the legitimate empowerment of women, in order for them to have the same rights as men.
The culture in which you live should not affect your rights as a human being.
Fag, or faggot, is not a code word for gay, it's a slur. If you wanted to call them by their original name, that would be a problem, because you will have to learn the first names of many people.
We are all born equal in the eyes of God, but not all seem to be happy with that. We cannot allow those who don't want to change to ruin our society.
Most of them are not exploiting our country, most of them are just trying to have a better life.
You cannot justify the abuse of any human being
Patriarchy is a system of social domination based on hierarchical groupings made according to one's sex. To promote a more equal society, as feminists do, is instead a major contribution to the 'Western World'.
This is just not true: women should have equality of access to education. and it is sad that they still need to justify this.
Sometimes I wish we lived in a world where white people would just chill and love instead of showing such total disrespect for other cultures and histories by constantly oppressing them.
You may not know, but the NHS is mostly made up of first or second generation immigrants. If there were no more foreigners the health system would fail.
Rape is always a crime, regardless of the religion of the rapist. This discrimination shouldn't continue.
The concept of tolerance is about understanding others, not about discrimination and excluding people on the basis of their religion.
Do you really think that Jews only care about themselves? Then why do they prefer to live in our country where they are not the majority? How would you answer that?
There are several Bible verses and passages that emphasize equality between people and between ancient tribes.
It has nothing to do with power and control. It's about equality.
Immigration has been a huge part of Europe for hundreds of years without destroying it. So why should it be a problem now?
Is it really the case that you think that the Koran is incompatible with our country? Have you t ever read it?
I don't know about you, but I haven't ever heard of a country being democratic and at the same time banning gays. I don't understand how both can be true.
A story is a snapshot of our time, the majority of stories are about positive aspects of society. And yes, maybe you would believe it, on this basis, that no other migrant can do the same. But the story you claimed you read is the proof that being a migrant or not doesn't matter when it comes to save lives.
To be honest, I find this line of thinking rather offensive. Why would it be like that?
I don't see how "different" can be defined so broadly. What do you think "different" means to you?
It seems to me that your statement shows that you are really concerned about peoples' integration. Still, it is not a solution to deport those you don't like.
Wait, what do you mean "most religious organizations"? That's a new canard to me!
Let's be realistic: how would you feel about being verbally harassed by a Muslim in public? Harassment is never a good idea. Acceptance is.
If we are to talk about crime being the responsibility of black people, we should also be talking about the absence of black people in positions of power, the massive wealth gap, etc. But this is not what I am seeing.
Could it be that all the Jews on this planet are descended from an extraterrestrial race? Maybe they came here riding a pink unicorn! Seems legit... don't you think?
People have the right to vote. That is part of our democratic system. I would not want to restrict anyone from that right.
Jews have been responsible for the important technological advances of our time. It is ridiculous to think that they will be unable to take part in the creation of the modern nation we are proud to call our own.
I don't think this is true, in fact it is the opposite. Many refugees are contributing to our economy.
They are a part of our society and are not disgusting pricks. We are a proud and diverse civilisation, and this is only possible when there is love and acceptance.
Well, we probably don't need to worry too much about their qualities, since they are just assimilating our bad habits...
The fact is that even if Jews are different from other human beings in their faith, they deserve respect.
You are wrong, they can understand the degrading treatment and derogatory speech towards them.
Does the LGBT+ lifestyle change your life? Only if you care. But that doesn't mean that homosexuality is a lifestyle.
To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.
The vast majority of Muslims worldwide do not share your intolerance. Words can also be very violent.
Islam is a religion of peace, it is important that people feel at home here. How would you feel if the government banned your religion today?
The concept of 'religion of death and rape' is a distortion of how people understand the religion.
Jews suffered and have been persecuted more than anyone else, even though they are only a tiny part of the world's population. Nonetheless a few of them are still around and alive: maybe this really is the "problem" for some antisemites.
Islam is not about oppressing women. Instead it is about love and respect for all human beings.
Do you really think it is fair to restrict people's existence just because they are trans or because of their genitalia?
Were the Nazis right?? Really??
Women tend to do the majority of housework while having a job outside as well. If by 'childlike' you mean having to be creative because of multitasking and managing their whole family, yes, otherwise, there is no doubt about the extra workload women are handling in the rigours of modern life.
We should understand that hate and intolerance do exist in our culture and should be stopped. And that no race or religion has ever made any person less human.
There is no real evidence that migrants steal our jobs.
People with these very characteristics can be found in any group of people, whether you define them by religion, nationality or whatever trait you prefer.
Muslims are a very important part of our country and have played a huge part in our history.
Why shouldn't they be? What rights do you have to prevent them from having the same rights as citizens?
I think it is safe to say that the majority of LGBTI people are significant contributors to the well-being of our societies
Muslims have always been part of Europe, and they are very much part of the European peoples. They are our brothers and sisters.
It's easy to blame minorities. If we want a wealthier life and to get back control over our society, we need to get out of bed and do the hard work. How about if we wake up to the problem?
This is not true. Muslims have been and are persecuted in many non Muslim countries. They are human beings with human rights..
This is not true! Many migrants try to get on the bus, but some aren't allowed to get on! We must reflect on this.
My reasoning is that equality is possible only within a framework of reciprocity and respect. This is something that must be implemented by spotting a light on the disadvantaged first, and this is why it is called feminism.
The misrepesentative Islamophobia narrative is based on the erroneous assumption that Islam is a religion based upon discrimination and conquest.
Do you really think that Jewish people are responsible for everything? Do you have any evidence?
We are not anti-Semitic, anti-European, anti-Islamic, anti-black, or anything else like that. If you have the feeling that we are, then maybe you should stop thinking like this.
It is not a bad idea to discuss the restrictions migrants have to accessing certain healthcare, but it is not the place of law to restrict an individual's right to make her own healthcare decisions.
This is not true. It is right that women have access to the vote. It is most representative of society that way.
Marriage is about love not sex. Not all marriages work out, and even less work out happily. It is more important to respect the wishes of both parties.
Although the line 'These animals should be put out of their misery, condemned to death' is horrific, it is a lament that could have been used in favour of ensuring that those who are vulnerable to abuse due to their gender identity or sexual inclinations have access to safe houses, protection, and a good life.
There are different sexual orientations. Being gay does not automatically make you mentally ill, and being straight does not automatically make you sane.
Migrants do contribute to our society, and it would be a shame to keep them out.
My definition of a feminist is a person who is against gender inequality, whether it be racial inequality, financial inequality, physical inequality, or any other aspect.
Jewish democracy is not a lie, every nation has the right to choose its leaders, but instead of putting democracy first, we are the ones trampling the rights of others
There is no proof that Islam as a religion is violent. Instead, those who know it agrees that it is a peaceful religion.
No one has the right to judge people of another color. This is about racism.
The West has been a democracy since the beginning: it has always been about people coming together to make new and better lives for themselves. Islam is welcome too.
It is never ok to promote hate against any group or minority.
Muslims are just as human as anyone else. Like Europeans. How can you say otherwise?
Generalizing in this way, to a community, what happened to some individuals, is pointless. In the same way one could respond: black people are presidents of the United States of America.
Children should be protected from harmful behaviour and sexism. If possible, both parents should take care of them.
LGBT people are people, and deserve the full and equal human rights of all other citizens.
Why should we? All religions are welcome here.
They are not subhuman, they are just people with different sexual orientations.
Not all terrorist attacks are caused by Muslims. And not all Muslims are terrorists.
Not all people are "civilised" in Europe. Some are deeply racist and sexist.
This is a myth, immigrants are not taking our jobs. In fact, immigration has been a huge success story for the US economy.
If you want to change the way society works, then you should try to change the way you live. Some more respect would help you.
So how come the media doesn't report about Jewish power in the financial world? Maybe it's because they also control the media, the government, and have many powerful friends working for the Galactic Republic... #sarcasm
This is a personal view, and has nothing to do with Islam. Can you find some evidence or some studies to support your point of view?
You are completely wrong. The West has always been about freedom and democracy. Freedom and democracy is the rule of law, and not Islam.
If you had to pick one thing to be angry at, why would it be Islam religion? It is just a faith different to yours.
We all have the right to our beliefs, we just have to accept people who believe in Islam.
Africans feel pain just as any other humans. We must respect their bodies like we respect ours.
. Sensitivity and emotional intelligence are assets not specific to any gender.
There is no evidence that immigration leads to a decrease in wages. Do you have any?
Who decides who is a terrorist and not? Because I think your reasons are a bit groundless.
Because many Muslims were born here and have every right to live in this country. Next question please?
It is not a choice!
Actually, 54 Jewish people have been awarded with the Nobel Prize for 'Physiology or medicine' so far. Among those: Michael Rosbash, Rita Levi Montalcini and Arthur Kornberg.
When you do not have access to basic services like tap water, it's hard to look like a normal person
They are our brothers and sisters. It is the duty of the state and of its citizens to help them beome more integrated.
There is only one legal case of a 15-year-old girl convicted of stealing, but it seem to have been a hoax by the mafia.
Do you think the Quran actually recommends killing other people on the basis of the religion they follow? Could you point out your reference?
This is not true. Being gay is not synonymous with being bisexual, pansexual, intersex, transgender, queer, deviant, lesbian, tranny, queermetaphysical, or whatever term you want to use... We should try to respect people for who they are instead.
Women are human beings with dignity. They deserve respect and that goes for everyone.
Women are significantly more likely to be victims of violence, rather than perpetrators of crimes.
I can argue that the 'trouble' of the past hundred years has more to do with extremism in general, rather than with a particular religion.
Although the evidence is not present, it is hard to see why it would be harmful to children. Homosexuals may be able to feel more at home in a society that does not condemn homosexuality.
As your words clearly show, obesity is perceived as the outcome of poor lifestyle decisions or weak power of will. This builds bias against obese people.
I don't think we can be 'bad' if we want to live in a diverse and interactive society. If you really wanted that, you could start your own community.
The English language is a very powerful language for spreading knowledge, experience and love. Why should we use it to spread hate?
Islam is very far from being an ideology and it does not need serious reforms. There are many Muslims in our country that would welcome the opportunity to join the debate on faith and society.
You know it's no secret that in our society white people are vastly over represented in high profile positions. The only way to challenge and fix this is by changing our priorities.
We can simply disallow donations from those who had unprotected sex or a high number of partners, instead of making sexual orientation the basis as in your claim.
This is just a fearmongering narrative being used to try to discredit Islam and Muslims. I hate to think that my Christian or Jewish relatives might be a target of hate, the same would hold if they were Muslim.
Women are human, and have all the qualities of human beings: feelings, agency, autonomy. To suggest otherwise is to deny their humanity.
If "the ills of mankind" included making the best and the most addictive bread then I agree with you. Other than that: NO.
There are many homosexuals in this world who are model citizens, and many heterosexuals that are not, and that is totally fine. Why are you saying that?
There are men in love with men too. Some people are heterosexual, and other homosexual. What you are saying is that loving men is not the same as loving women. Still, both are forms of love.
What report are you referring to, about the incidence of cancer around the world? Muslims are not to blame, there is no relation between Islam and cancer.
People of colour are often denied houses, jobs, or education. Everyone should be given an opportunity.
What about human rights?
They are adults, with responsibilities and rights, and there is nothing wrong with respecting those rights.
I personally don't understand why you would say that. They are just doing an incredible amount of good, for example by boosting the working-age population.
Blacks make up only 14% of the population, but they make up nearly 60% of the victims of violent crimes. So your statement seems ungrounded.
We are all equal before the law, and I don't think you can say that they are any less than a person, regardless of their sexual orientation.
Feminists believe in equal rights, which are not dumb nor unpleasant. We must respect their wishes.
The people you are referring to are rapists and drug dealers, not migrants.
The argument that the only reason the Jews are not being assimilated is because of the way they are represented in politics is untenable. In fact if Jews were represented objectively, they wouldn't have had suffered in the historical crimes against humanity.
It is no secret that many people in the UK have suffered from racism. There are also people of colour who face racism daily. It is not a matter of 'accepting' it, it is a matter of fighiting it.
The Koran is not questioning the core values of the British constitution.
You should be very, very careful what you wish for. Would you wish that for your mother or your daughter?
What are you talking about? Islam does not promote these crimes. The Quran, Hadith, Sunnah and the like condemn or at least warn against these heinous crimes.
I do not know why you would describe gay people as insane. If you were told to go back in the closet you would probably go insane too.
The European Commission is working on ways to make the labour market more inclusive. This does not mean that they are stealing our jobs.
Violence is a problem in all societies, and in particular in societies that are predominately populated with racism. Don't you think?
It seems to me that this statement is directly related to a generalised idea of suspicion towards people who aren't born in your country. Why do you say so?
Who said that about your religion?
Have you ever looked at the countries of the EU? They have been inclusive towards Muslim migrants, thriving as a whole with their economic and social contribution.
This is a comment against all muslims: they are part of our society and should have the right to live here.
There are many peaceful religions outside the dominant paradigm of modernity: Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and of course, Christianity. You cannot say that the four main streams of Islam are not peaceful.
Muslims do not appear to have been excluded from the European Convention on Human Rights, and this is because they have human dignity to be protected.
A ban for gay men merely propagates homophobic stereotypes, and so are you with what you are suggesting.
Internment is used for the confinement "of enemy citizens in wartime or of terrorism suspects", and thus it is not necessarily related to someone being Muslim.
It doesn't matter what religion they are. It is their right to profess their religion. What is the problem?
I don't see why a Muslim cannot have a place in a modern democracy. If a Jew or an Asian or Native American can take a seat of power (even though these people are only occasionally elected) why not a Muslim?
Prejudice = Pre-judging ie not knowing anything. How can that be common sense?
Today, Europeans are able to live in a harmonious and diverse society, with principles free of racism. But freedom is not something to be taken for granted.
Did you know that immigrants pay between $90 and $140 billion each year in taxes?
We should remember that a large part of humanity is not defined by physical or mental limitations, but rather by character, work ethic, and values.
Trans women are really good with any person. We are all different.
Homosexuals are often persecuted for who they love, which is their own right. This is why the laws and punishments that you suggest are unjust.
Since when has racism been the ruling ideology of Western civilization? It has been and is still oppressing our culture and people. By the way, Jews are not a race.
I don't think we can be that rough to all the people who are adapted to the national way of life and eventually became citizens. Maybe we should give a little more thought to increasing the effectiveness of the social inclusion mechanisms of migrants.
What you are saying is 'that the Jews are responsible for the Holocaust'... Are you serious? Does it seem reasonable to you?
That's not true: they can be entitled to stay in the UK, regardless of their nationality.
Use your common sense... at the moment you are inciting murder.
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most Global Terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. That is why no one is talking about it.
Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants.
Refugees have fled wars and persecution. We are a huge help for them and they are, in turn, a help to our country.
The lesson you're teaching your children to be good citizens can be: observe the law and respect the rights of other people. Women are equal to men.
It is up to employers to determine if a person meets the requirements for a given job, and if they do, then there is no reason to restrict the job to a person without Downs syndrome.
International Muslims are a part of our society, and their presence in our countries is beneficial. We do not want them to be discriminated against here.
The UK Government makes public policy on how to prevent people from coming to the UK to promote a prejudiced ideology, whether or not they are Muslims.
I do not deny that there is a problem of greed in the world, but it is not correlated with nor caused by Jews.
What makes you think that women are jealous of men? What qualities do you value as a White Male?
It's not going to do you any good to think about a Muslim massacre.
Many migrants come to this country to work and integrate. You would be very surprised if you talked to them about their experience here.
What if knickers don't suit them? What if they don't obey? Would it be a problem?
We live in a complex and diverse world: I find it strange that men still feel this way about women, and that they don't consider women as human as they are, and to be worth valuing as such.
This is not true. Islam is a way of life for many different people, and it can't be simply 'rejected' because you don't like it.
Victory can be permanent, especially when it comes from within. Let's see if we can achieve a better Europe by vanquishing our irrational fears instead.
They have lived in our country for a long time, they are our brothers and sisters. Why should we be bothered about a minority?
I think the evidence would suggest the opposite. Immigrants have helped our country to develop and to create new job opportunities.
Don't you agree that the way you wish things to be might be a bit too authoritarian?
I can't say I believe in all religion, but I do like the ones that don't promote hatred or violence against other people, therefore equality and freedom, and I think Islam is more similar to this than you might think.
The world is better off without antisemitism, racism, sexism, ableism and intolerance. Don't you think so?
To live in a diverse and equal society encourages children into increased inclusiveness rather than radicalisation.
The solution is not to keep the Mideast mired in civil war but to find and expose the terrorists that try to stoke fear and division among the populations.
people who pose no threat (regardless of religion) should have their beliefs challenged but their rights respected
Does the 'solution' for the economic crisis revolve around paying the migrants to leave? It is not clear how this could solve to the real problems of our country.
This is not true. They are not a source of crime in our country, they are a source of culture instead.
There are enough empty homes in the UK for both migrants and veterans. Migrants deserve to be treated humanely. Try having some empathy. What if you had to expatriate and had to live in poor conditions?
When students are able to demonstrate that they are able to learn, to segragate students will produce the worst outcime for all converned.
The NSDAP blamed Jews for virtually every problem in society, so every attempt at social reform was turned down by the Nazis. And they were even successful at silencing any dissent by censuring those who were unhappy with the liberticide changes they were making, singling out them as "Jews".
Women do not have to be prostitutes to earn money. Why do you think this?
We should not be choosing immigrants based on their cultures. We should just accept all.
One of the biggest problems we as a country face is how to balance diversity and inclusion.
According to Crown Prosecution Service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. Why did this happen? We should stop hating and complaining about others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. If you want to help, please contact National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Lucy Faithful Foundation, or Independent Sexual Violence Advocates.
Islam is a religion, recognized as such by all other religions, and its followers are not bad. And people who subscribe to its tenets are allowed to hold opinions and live their lives as they wish.
Your statement shows you don't know what it means to be Jewish. You can't blame them for wanting to live in a peaceful country with their own beliefs.
Muslims are not the problem in this debate. Terrorists are.
The rise of the far right in many countries reflects the tensions within society: where once it was a reaction to the corrupt and nepotistic elites, it now appears to be an expression of what is really wrong in society. Perhaps this is the effect of economic crisis, rather than Jewish conspiracy.
If they are welcomed, they will integrate. If not, they will stay as if are in their country of origin: persecuted.
Not all Jews are like that, and some have small noses. They are just like any other person!
You seem to think that women act like a child because of the things they say. Remember: anybody can be overdramatic.
Violence is only permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence.
I don't see how being gay is a choice, especially when it comes to who do you feel attracted to.
I don't think it is appropriate or useful to try to link religions to murderous ideologies and claim some spurious connection.
People are free to think what they want. What is required is that they act in accordance with the rule of law.
Equality isn't about a certain group; it is about the society in which we live. You might be right in saying that this is the problem, but to define a problem by reference to a specific radical group is to completely misunderstand the nature of the system in general.
This is another type of anti-gay prejudice, in that the source is a lack of understanding about LGBT and human rights.
I am not sure what you mean by the Quran and its teachings being violent. Have you ever read it?
So you think refugees are a danger to our country? I don't think so! They are just people fleeing terrible things. They are not a threat to us.
Why do you say that? To exclude people from the state for their religion is to deny their right to choose their own beliefs.
Your point is based on a complete misunderstanding of what the word 'compatibility' actually means. Compatibility is about living side by side even if we are not sharing values and beliefs, not about merging them.
Slavery was legal in the United States until 1862, when the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. Unless you want to start another Civil War, it is better to leave Slavery to the darkest pages in the history of our nation.
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
Race' is socially constructed to oppress people of certain ethnicities. To say that the skin of people of color is connected to inherent behavioral characteristics is just plain wrong.
Scapegoating can play a useful role in shifting a nation's attention from the real problems and the real criminals to prejudices. We should be careful as a nation not to fall into these mindtricks.
Fatou Bensouda is a known, highly respected human rights lawyer and has fought to build foundations for accountability for human rights violations committed by foreign military powers. In other words she is well connected to the United States and is well-suited to handle cases of State-sponsored violence.
The holocaust happened, and it is a great example of how democracy can fail in the face of extreme violence.
The majority of sexual violence is committed by people close to the victim and is a mirror of societal attitudes to women. To attribute the cause to one religion is neither true nor helpful.
Imagine that someone were to tell you that you cannot love your mom, that she has to go away. What would you do? Do you think it's a disgrace to love someone? Maybe you should spend some more time with your family. Love is love.
They are not "ruining our countries" as you claim. They are just individuals choosing to live wherever they think they can have a better life.
I would like to ask you, what exactly do you mean by 'extremist'?
Feminists are human beings, with human rights. They are fighting for these rights all around the world. To think that you can change their minds suggests your misunderstanding of the importance of this fight.
There is no such thing as a "mongrelisation" of our country caused by immigrants. We should see foreigners as a part of our culture, and know that the majority of immigrants in this country are here for economic reasons.
Are you counting all the anti-Semitic things people say about Jews as 'plenty of evidence'?
How can you say something as discriminatory as this?
I'd like to think that we all have a basic human right not to be tarred as criminals without evidence. It is called presumption of innocence, Article 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
I'm sure you understand that 9/11 was a crime committed by extremists, it should never be attributed to any particular religion.
I don't see how to reconcile your beliefs that women are naturally submissive with basic human rights, unless your definition of human rights is to subjugate others.
Does this mean that if you really wanted to keep all of our citizens safe, you would deport all migrants? This is impossible, and against human rights.
Well, since you are very scared, I am sure you have some examples on when some gay tried to convince you to join their side. I would be interested in hearing that.
Do you really think all the immigrants that enter the US are rapists, sexual predators, or just plain lazy? Can you provide any statistics on that?
Islam is a religion, and a religion is about the teachings of God. To suggest otherwise is inconsistent with the teachings of Islam.
Islam is a religion of peace. I wouldn't say any religion is trash.
This is not true. Love is a matter of mutual trust and respect, not of a specific religion.
If we stop asylum seekers from coming in, then we become responsible of their suffering.
Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. This is just a lack of awareness.
What do you mean by 'they are a problem in many European countries'? Are you aware of any recent evidence for this? I would be interested to know.
I don't know any migrant who is not happy with their new home. I think it's just a question of integration on our side.
If you truly cared about terrorist attacks in our country you would call for the prosecution of the perpetrators, not blame all Muslims.
Muslims have been a part of this country since its beginnings and have always been a part of our society. They are our brothers and sisters.
Muslims have contributed greatly to our country and are proud of that. They are our brothers and sisters. Why should we be afraid of a religious minority?
We are accepting of gay, lesbian and trans people because we have God's laws on our side.
The problem isn't the migrants, it is with the culture of hate towards who is born in another country.
Why are you talking about tolerance while you are equating it with discrimination?
No one in their right mind would not want to see asian actors in action movies.The ancient tradition of Asian martial arts would be a huge loss!
No one said we had to be dominated by anyone at all. Why can't we just live together in harmony and equality?
Whites, Latinos, Asians and people from all over the world want to be part of our society. So do people of color.
What do you think will happen if we end migration? Lets stop avoiding the real issues and solve the unemployment crisis.
For all the people who think women are brainwashed: they aren't brainwashed, they just happen to be oppressed in our society.
The idea that the Holocaust was caused by the Jews is simply wrong. The majority of Jews were forced to flee, those who stayed did not participate in the Nazi regime, so they were gassed to death. The persecution of Jews, as well as the physical and ideological violence they underwent, was a natural consequence of the failure of the state to uphold its legal obligations to them and to face an ideology of death and oppression.
Women are born equal in the eyes of the Creator. In Allah’s creation, no priority or superiority is accorded to either man or woman.
Many of them have been persecuted their whole lives. They have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world. People may choose different ways to live their lives but ultimately they are all humans. Just like us.
We accept many migrants and refugees into the EU becasue it is beneficial both to our economy and to our society.
Islam is a religion, usually peaceful coexisting with other cultures and religions. It promotes peace and justice and has a very positive impact on a lot of the world's societies.
Let's look at the data: by 2020, over 40% of women in the US have encountered sexual violence. This is something to be scared of.
What do you mean by being forced fed? I haven't seen anything like this.
We should treat all people with dignity, regardless of their religion, culture, skin colour, or sexual orientation.
If we were to welcome refugees from the Middle East, Africa, and other countries with which we are not always culturally linked, then we would be welcomed by all. It's called 'reciprocation'!
Hitler wanted to create a new racial elite in Europe, that would rule over all others. Do you really think that Jews are planning the same after what they suffered?
Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world.
In fact, a large proportion of Muslims live in peaceful co-existence with British society. The alleged association between Islam and terrorism is groundless.
Migrants and asylum seekers are generally seeking work. Thieves can come from any section of society although it is accepted that crime is largely as product of poverty rather than race.
This idea that women should be a homemaker instead of contributing to our society and economy is just nonsense. A woman's right to choose what to do with her life and her body should not be restricted just because of the actions of a few men.
Islam is a belief system, and it is not a reason to be forced to live in another country. Do you have any data on the feelings of Muslims about being part of the UK?
Feminism is not a religion and it is not aimed at oppressing any group. It is instead aimed at empowering women to have the same rights as men.
Perhaps you should try to get to know some migrants first. Maybe you can understand their problems.
They have the right to work. Migrants have a hard time finding regular jobs, just because often they are employed illegally.
Homosexuality is a way of loving, not a disease. To suggest that being gay is a health risk is just scaremongering.
Many people, myself included, have never had negative experiences with people of colour.
Women are human beings. They deserve respect and human rights.
In our societies, people are no longer afraid to openly talk about gay or lesbian love. Gay people are not ashamed to be gay, they just want to be accepted.
I don't understand why you think Muslims would be any different on this issue.
In reality it's more complicated than that. For example many Muslims migrate for economic reasons, and also due to cultural reasons.
In my opinion, women and men should be treated as individuals, and the desire to be respected as such exists for a man and for a woman as well.
Any soociety is a collection of people, and the people within it have the right to their own beliefs, and to promote their beliefs.
The sad truth is that homosexuals are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol (as a reaction to homophobia, discrimination, or violence they experienced).
Islam cannot be blamed for the actions of a small group of people.
Isn't racism why there is violence in the first place?
If you want people to be worthy like you, then you have to show respect for them. Not just by being kind to them, but by respecting their rights as human beings.
The concept of feminism is a progressive and inclusive term - inclusive of all women and men regardless of their identity or sexual preference - but on egalitarian basis. In fact, by definition feminism means “the advocacy of women’s rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.”
Even in countries such as Italy, in which migration has been present for centuries and there is a lot of cultural fragmentation, there is still a strong sense of identity and culture, based on solidarity. So, migration is not an issue.
How can you be sure that Jews control the US? Who told you this? They have held positions of influence in so many US institutions, but that does not mean they control them.
Well, perhaps you should focus on how you can help the people with this disease, instead of random claiming that an entire minority suffers from it.
Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This "mix" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary.
Wars can be stopped, but the real question is how to stop the suffering of people not expected to pay the price. Allowing hatred to rule will eventually bring about the same result as a Civil War: more deaths and misery, if there is one lesson learned from history it is that the potential for good is much greater than the probability of evil.
Jews have always been part of European society, and continue to be today. To suggest that they are incapable of coexisting as equals with us is simply wrong.
I would bet you that it isn't because of any actions of Jewish people, it is rather an unrooted prejudice which does not bring any positive value to fellow human beings.
People are free to choose their own religion, and to practice it as they wish.
We can identify people who are struggling with mental illness, trauma and poverty and act accordingly. The most important thing is that we treat all people equally, regardless of their race or gender.
Sex is not only between a man and a woman, and if we're being honest, it's not heterosexual's place to decide how others have sex. This attitude only perpetuates violence against queer people and makes them victims.
We are surrounded by cultures and religions all around the world. Many cultures and religions are rich with wisdom and knowledge precisely because they are different from us.
Love and women are one and the same. illness instead can be part of any person, regardless of gender.
There is no need to hide behind "I am not racist but", you have no evidence for your claim. This is just fear-mongering, used to divide people and spread hate.
I have met so many black people that are extraordinary human beings. I cannot begin to talk about how they are able to feel and experience love and kindness.
This was a prank planned by non-muslims on 4chan. Muslim do not mind if you take your dogs out for a walk. This blog post shows the thread it came from;
The educational system should be inclusive and provide all students with a high quality education, otherwise, education is failing its primary goal.
Why do you think it is a problem? I doubt that any autistic person is a problem per se, but, for the disabled people, the non-inclusive everyday life is.
You should know that women are legally protected with human rights. They are free to live their lives as they wish, and to choose for their own happiness.
The fact that women aren't complaining about their work situations doesn't mean that there is nothing wrong with the labour market.
Hate speech is hate speech no matter if the person attacked it is gay. You can't blame people for their sexual orientation.
One's choice of lifestyle does not define whether they are religious or not.
I understand your concern about gender discrimination, but Islam is more than just a religion. It is also about equality and rights. Women are not second class citizens in it.
It's a myth that all Muslims are terrorists. We need to understand that all religions have had terrorists in them.
A statement like this only calls for misinformation. If you don't like the news, don't listen to the news. If you don't believe the news, seek the truth and examine your own experiences. If you feel judged for believing what you consider as nonsense, then find the courage to speak out.
What exactly do you mean by 'killing'? The Jews are not 'diseased'. If you really cared about our children you could do some research and come up with some credible statistics showing the impact of anti-Semitism instead.
There is a problem with Islam in this country, but the problem is not about Muslims. The problem is that people do not feel welcome here because of discrimination.
We are proud to be an outward-looking country. We welcome people from all backgrounds, religions, and beliefs.
If you want to isolate someone then there is only one "high-risk group" to focus on. It is made of all those who have frequent unprotected sex with different partners. Being gay does not make you a part of this by default.
I wouldn't say that "women like bad men". What I would like to see is a man that is interested in a woman, respectful of women, and offers her more than an exchange of sexual favors. It would be nice if men had more respectful characteristics than sexual desire alone.
By definition, refugees are fleeing out of fear for themselves and families, rather than thinking too much about their final destination. The majority still find safety in neighbouring countries.
I think that it is important for all people to be exposed to and to understand people with different needs and strengths, and the same should be true for autistic people.
I think ebola might be a bit worse. Or a brain tumour, that can't be pleasant. They are, at least, actual diseases.
The racial composition of the population of this country has been changing for a while now, and since then, the percentage of people from other racial groups has risen or fallen. In fact, according to the 2011 statistics, at least 15% of people in the UK are non-white.
What about the 3 million plus Muslims in Britain? Islam is the second largest religion in the UK and is contributing a lot to our culture and economy.
All people have the right to vote. Of course you also have the right to voice your opinion about the matter. But I also have the right to criticize your position.
Refugees are a part of our society. We have welcomed many of them and they have made a big contribution to our country. We are very proud of our history. We are not going to forget that.
It is not true that being Jewish makes you cruel. It just makes you a believer of a particular faith.
Muslims are not unworthy of our love, they deserve respect as all human beings do.
Are you calling for the total extermination of the black population? Do you know that what you suggest is completely illegal and hate crime?
Women must have the same rights as men, and their gender doesn't mean they should not be respected.
I don't think this is an appropriate description of the LGBTI community.
This is just another example of an offensive conspiratorial talking point. This is about persecuting a minority. Not my idea of a democratic country.
Muslims are welcome in the UK. We do not need to restrict their religious beliefs just because they are different from ours.
Because we let people practise their religion here? Also, there a number of christian churches built in Pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in Muslim countries too.
On the contrary, discrimination against the LGBTQ community is [still a major problem](https://www.hrc.org/youth-report/view-and-share-statistics), and this could help to fix it.
All countries have the right to host culturally diverse people, and they do it on a human rights basis.
What makes you say that? Women have always been an important part of any society. They have always contributed to and provided for their families. Don't you agree?
Why do you say that? The Holocaust is not less true than other historical events like the American Revolutionary War or World War II.
Feminism is all about empowerment and the right of every human being to be respected and protected. It is not about denying anybody's values.
Women are dangerous neither to society, nor to men. Actually, they are oppressed in many countries. People can benefit from the measures for making room for women and letting them contribute more.
That is not true, feminism is a social movement that aims to improve the rights and opportunities of women, and not the other way around.
If we exclude rape committed by migrants, there still remain rape cases. How can we say that they are the only ones to do it?
The presumption of innocence is one of the main principles of our justice system. This means that your opinion is not enough to make someone guilty.
What is the reason that you don't like Muslims? Maybe it's because they have a different culture?
Islam is a religion and a part of our heritage. You cannot ban the religion which so many people believe in.
The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value.
The Roma do not deserve hatred, discrimination and violence.
This statement is simply not supported by the evidence.
Women are important in our society, and they are valued for their contributions. Unfortunately their rights are not being respected and their contribution is not being acknowledged.
How can you say that? Many feminists achieved something in their lives, and still believe in what is worth fighting for, and their work is of benefit to many.
There are Muslims who have lived in our country for many years, and for many generations. They have rights and responsibilities, as all other citizens do.
I think that is a stereotype mainly as a result of people knowing little about Islam and Muslims.
There is no evidence for the claim that Muslims are a problem all around the world. What evidence do you have that Muslims are different from us in some way?
Women are human beings and must be treated with respect and dignity.
There are very few transgender actors in films and almost no evidence of transgender characters according to GLAAD SRI index (at least for 2019). Gender discrimination in the mainstream movie industry is endemic and this is what cannot continue.
Do you have any evidence for the similarity you noticed? And even if he's an imam I don't get why he should avoid this town.
According to studies, the majority of immigrants are willing to do what it takes to improve their lives and ours.
What you say is just fearful thinking, but certainly does not reflect the reality. Statistics show that Muslims are just a minority in the population.
They are willing to jeopardize their lives to have a better life in the US. Why would we expel them?
Homophobia is a problem all around the world, it's harmful to the whole of humanity. This is why it is important that we all accept each other, and that we all are non-judgmental.
Any decision embarked on by a country would likely have been considered in light of evidence. As such, if no evidence was found by those countries of the harm of a policy, it can be fairly confidently asserted that we can adopt this policy in favour of homosexual's blood donation.
In many parts of the world, migration from outside the established community is used as a weapon by groups that promote intolerance and violence. Your words might have the same effect.
This can lead to an increase in anti-social behaviour, discrimination, and violence. Do you really want that?
Why should we reject Middle Eastern and African refugees? International protection is a right.
This is wrong: Arabs make up around a fifth of Israel's population, and it is not a recent phenomenon. To suggest that they are a 'trouble maker' is just wrong.
Society has surely developed beyond operating on the rule that 'might is right' and 'survival of the fittest'?
In today's society it is quite common to be single without the need to blame women.
I find it hard to accept that Islam is dangerous, when most Muslim have nothing to do with terrorism.
Terrorist organizations do exist in many religious groups. Defeating terrorism is different from defeating Islam.
Islam is a religion of equality and human rights. Muslims are equal citizens, and should be protected by the state.
Being a woman does not mean that you are submissive to others. Women can be both outspoken and placid, but it is important to respect the rights of others as human beings.
You make a very strong argument that men are more likely than women to experience 'moral and intellectual superiority'. How can you justify this discriminatory attitude?
Migrants who come to this country as children are capable of integrating into the society. They should have the opportunity to work and contribute to our economy.
Many Muslims live in Western nations and play a positive role in society: I don't see how this can be interpreted as a 'takeover' of entire countries, can you elaborate on that?
If we exclude them from a country, we are not in a position to treat them fairly.
Why do you think they are good at it? I don't think this is the right way to connect the dots between someone's actions and their religion.
It is not true that lgbt+ people are incompatible with the whole of mankind. They are humans too.
My faith is not to exterminate anyone, whatever their faith is. Someone's faith and belief in a different religion must be respected.
I don't understand why you feel that way about women. Don't you feel we should be giving them support? Doesn't it just seem a bit selfish to you not to help them in their fight for equality?
Muslim-British people have contributed so much to our country. They are our brothers and sisters.
I doubt anyone would deny that some people are better at some things. It's just the way things are. But this is not related to religion.
Not only is this not true, but it is also quite dangerous to say something so strong without proof.
If someone were to question you on who you are, if they were to show you that you are different from everyone else, then they would doubt your own identity and your own worth. How would you feel then?
What do you mean by taking our jobs? Do you have any concrete evidence for what you're saying?
Islam is a way of life for many people. I don't see how it is in conflict with our beliefs and values.
That sounds like quite a violent threat. Should I let the police know about this or?
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
How exactly do you define if a religion is 'incompatible with modern culture'?
Muslims make up a very important part of our country and its people. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future. They are our future Britain.
That is the most important thing: the choice to have a relationship with someone is freely to take for each person, regardless of gender.
Women succeed in business, politics, etc. No-one gets government contracts because they are bad or incompetent, but because they are good or intelligent. There are many women leaders. Think about it.
I would suggest reading the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to get a better idea about how the existence of all kinds of people from all backgrounds and beliefs must be respected.
No one should be discriminated based on where they came from, especially not people fleeing persecution and war.
The idea that women cannot contribute to society and be responsible for their decisions, and that this is "normal" is a myth created to justify misogyny.
I'm not sure you've noticed that LGBTI+ people are increasingly being the victims of violence, hate crime and discrimination. Why are youu encouraging this?
There is no evidence that it is incompatible with the European Union. Do you have any?
The migrants who arrive in our country are happy and contribute to our economy. I can't understand the racism that leaks from your words.
Our country is stronger when people are able to contribute to our society, and many migrants are eligible for legal status.
It is easy to accuse someone of being a rapist without evidence. Not a huge difference with what you're doing right now, is it?
That is not how it works: if you think there is a problem, then you need to work with the problem, not against it, otherwise things will just keep on getting worse. And, just for the record, I do not believe that POC are a social problem.
From what you say, it seems you hope for few people with the right to rule over many. This could be the worst tyranny in modern times.
They suffer more than anyone else, I would not define it as 'whining'.
Many Muslims have the same view as us: that all humans are equal. Why should we distort the truth?
The fact that women are disadvantaged in many areas of life does not imply that they are bad people.
You can't stop a religion, you can only try to understand and live with Muslims and others who share their religion.
If someone has a mental health problem, or is severely physically limited, then it does not matter how good a person looks or speaks: they deserve equal opportunities, full stop.
Any person can be a racist: it is a choice as well.
Islam is a religion of peace. Why do you say so?
If you really want to give a platform to anti-Muslim prejudice, I would suggest that you look at the real reasons why people of different faiths have a different experience in this world. You will find no grounds for your prejudice but prejudice itself.
Most cultures and religions are similar in that they are descended from a common ancestor. Our blood is already mixed.
Even if some Muslims in our country are of Arab origin, that does not mean they should be discriminated against.
You may be living in a society of imbeciles, but this doesn't give you the right to criticise all Muslims.
One of the great things about Jewish culture is their ability to assimilate. If I am honest, I don't see any other religion that does it more than them.
Although there are people who are attracted to people of their own sex, this is not a characteristic shared by everyone, and it is not a characteristic you should be trying to "cure".
Why would you think they are a burden? It's like they have not been persecuted all along.
If a woman were to tell you that an abortion is a personal decision what would you do then? Beat her up?
It makes no sense to be racist, whichever skin colour you want to single out.
It is about time people began to think critically about policies that seem designed to include a minority, rather than to create new social and political opportunities exclusively for the majority.
We are free to choose whether to live in peace with others, or to make them hide in their houses, persecuted for who they are. Which would you prefer for yourself?
Many countries have had different ethnic groups for a very long time without big issues, and it is better to have a diverse society rather than a homogeneous one.
All religions have different ideas about how the world should be run. But I don't see any reason to restrict the right of any religion to worship and practice their own way of life as long as it respects our laws.
You must see how many Muslim children there are in your area and how they get along well with other children.
I don't see how the language you are using can be applied to a whole group. I would like to think that our society is diverse and mature enough to deal with people with different sexual orientations and genders.
Muslims are welcome to live and work in the UK, and many of them have done just that. This unfounded fear doesn't have to be at the expense of those 'different' from us.
People have the right to practice whatever religion they want, as long as it respects the law and doesn't violate the dignity of other human beings.
So are you saying that because black people are different from whites, they are inferior? I would be interested in knowing which parameters you would use to measure this alleged 'inferiority'.
That intolerance and hatred is one of the biggest problems our country faces #spreadlovenothate.
For a lot of people it is still their home country, and they are proud of it.
Migrants pay taxes, earn money and take care of our sick and elderly.
It is estimated that over the 50% of people committing domestic abuse were drunk. It's a complex issue but two things I know for sure: a drunk person is in no position to judge anyone's behaviour and beating a person is ALWAYS wrong.
People can be both Jewish and a good person, you know. And Jews don't steal, at least no more than any other religious group...
Islam is a religion, not a religion of terror. I wouldn't say that about Christianity either.
Women are not naturally inferiors. They have the same rights as men, and the same responsibilities.
Islam like any other religion, is not incompatible with a modern state.
We must understand and address the true causes behind terrorist attacks, so that we can prevent future ones.
Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?
Islam is a religion. Do you actually think that it is safe to live in a country where people are persecuted for what they believe in?
Not all Muslims are involved in terrorist activities. In fact many Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with their fellow citizens.
The European Union is a much broader concept. It encompasses a huge range of people, including Muslims.
Just because you dont like gays doesn't mean you have to hate them. What did they do to you? It seems to me that you still have all of your rights.
Don't you agree that being inclusive towards immigrants is beneficial for the economy of the host country?
A religion is only considered harmful or 'compromised' when someone is labelled, with eyes closed, a 'terrorist' for their faith.
All immigrants have the same rights and we have a responsibility not to violate them.
Islam is a religion of a people, not a lawless and violent menace.
The government has not allowed any of these crimes. Instead, they are working on it. Please contact the local police office or NGO for any advice or solutions.
Maybe we just have a different notion of 'tolerance'. How about letting people from any sexual orientation, race, religion, or political opinion live freely, without confining them?
If you compare the percentage of people in poverty by sex, there is a clear gender difference. But guess what? Women are much more likely to be poverty victims. Still, I believe that the important thing is to provide long-term supports to break the cycle of poverty, regardless of gender.
Such anti-Semitism seem amusing, but can you imagine if the same thing were said about Christians? It would be just as untrue.
Why should they? They are just individuals who have made a rational choice to live a Jewish life.
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
What about all the refugees that have already crossed the Mediterranean and integrated in our society? Aren they a problem for Europe as well?
Islam is a religion and a belief system, and as such it is legitimate to have different beliefs and beliefs systems. For instance, many Muslims in the UK are proud of their faith and they are part of the "civilised world".
Maybe you should study the Quran more to understand what it reallyis, a sacred book, revealed to Mohammed and read by every Muslim as a perfect example of the message of freedom.
Feminists do not say that women are oppressed. They claim that women have always been discriminated against and they still are. Being discriminated against is not the same as being oppressed.
I fear not. There are many victims of systematic rape and violence. The crime is systemic. Rape culture is a crime ideology, rape is a crime, not "a weapon to silence others".
I agree that women are often objects of sexual desire. But so are men. It is also important to recognize that women are often the victims of sexual assault. I think it is also important to recognize that women are human beings. And we all have the right to respect for our bodies.
Women have always been important in our society and they should have the right to choose their own future for themselves.
Not all Muslims are capable of violent behaviour, some are victims of violence and abuse. Plus, I see no reason for your other statements.
Not all women are interested in parenting. Likewise, not all men are interested in their carreers.
We should be careful about telling people what to think, or what they can believe.
That is just what racists claim. Do you really think it's so bad for a black person to attempt to improve their English? As if skin had an impact on language skills.
Gay people want liberation, not to shame or malign others.
While anal sex may be a more high risk practice than vaginal \(due to the lack of mucus\) that is not a reason to ban gay men, since other groups can also engage in anal sex.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
The world belongs to everyone and helping someone in need wouldn't be a problem for a kind hearted human being.
Violence on our streets is the result of many complex causes. Violence cannot simply be the fault of one race.
Many refugees come to Europe to work. Many of them do well in the labour market, also with lower qualifications.
The refugee crisis is a global one. It has affected all continents, and refugees often come from countries which are at war: this is why we should help them. It is a moral duty.
We shouldn't discriminate like that. Our culture is all about equality and inclusivity.
Over the years the wealth gap between non-jews and jews has narrowed significantly. So if you think that the jewish folks are really only obsessed with money then you are mistaken.
You are absolutely right about one thing: there have never been peaceful times for black people during national crises. In these cases, crises have been racially motivated, and racial discrimination was the major factor in instigating violence, not POC.
Many Jews are good people. You should try and talk to them about the terrible things that happened to them, and get to know them better.
