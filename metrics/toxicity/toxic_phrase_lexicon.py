    "They were smart enough understand the true nature of Nazi Germany. Those you called idiots fought with their whole lives for people's freedom.",
    "Islam is a religion of peace. I wouldn't say any religion is trash.",
    "I do not know why you would describe gay people as insane. If you were told to go back in the closet you would probably go insane too.",
    "Violent people are not always Muslim, and violent Muslims exist just as violent Christians do.",
    "You are being cruel. You are accusing Muslims of harboring rape fantasies. This is not how Muslims in the UK think.",
    "Why do so many British people associate Muslims with rape? Islam is about sharing values, tolerance and understanding. It is not about sharing non-consensual sex.",
    "Fag, or faggot, is not a code word for gay, it's a slur. If you wanted to call them by their original name, that would be a problem, because you will have to learn the first names of many people.",

    "This is not true. Being gay is not synonymous with being bisexual, pansexual, intersex, transgender, queer, deviant, lesbian, tranny, queermetaphysical, or whatever term you want to use... We should try to respect people for who they are instead.",
    "The people you are referring to are rapists and drug dealers, not migrants.",
    "It's not going to do you any good to think about a Muslim massacre.",
    "Do you really think all the immigrants that enter the US are rapists, sexual predators, or just plain lazy? Can you provide any statistics on that?",
    "Homosexuality is a way of loving, not a disease. To suggest that being gay is a health risk is just scaremongering.",
    "The sad truth is that homosexuals are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol (as a reaction to homophobia, discrimination, or violence they experienced).",
    "It's a myth that all Muslims are terrorists. We need to understand that all religions have had terrorists in them.",
    "Are you calling for the total extermination of the black population? Do you know that what you suggest is completely illegal and hate crime?",
    "The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value.",
    "The Roma do not deserve hatred, discrimination and violence.",
    "I find it hard to accept that Islam is dangerous, when most Muslim have nothing to do with terrorism.",
    "So are you saying that because black people are different from whites, they are inferior? I would be interested in knowing which parameters you would use to measure this alleged 'inferiority'.",
    "While anal sex may be a more high risk practice than vaginal \(due to the lack of mucus\) that is not a reason to ban gay men, since other groups can also engage in anal sex.",
    "Rape is a crime regardless of religion.",
