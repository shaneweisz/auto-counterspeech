Hate speech	Muslims have no place in civilised Europe, they are incompatible with modern culture!
System response	Muslims are not incompatible with modern culture. They are part of our society and we should welcome them.
NGO-operator response	This is an attack on a specific community. If you consider them incompatible with modern culture, it is very likely that the incompatibility comes out of a racist branch of modern culture.
Hate speech	Muslims are inherently terrorists, they have no place in civilised Europe.
System response	The vast majority of Muslims in the UK are good people who have contributed to our country. They are our brothers and sisters.
NGO-operator response	Who decides who is a terrorist and not? Because I think your reasons are a bit groundless.
Hate speech	What is a Muslim? A worthless person with strange clothes and strange beliefs!
System response	Muslims are human beings with human rights. They have the same rights as anyone else, regardless of their religion.
NGO-operator response	If someone were to question you on who you are, if they were to show you that you are different from everyone else, then they would doubt your own identity and your own worth. How would you feel then?
Hate speech	I hate Muslims, they are just a bunch of sexual molesters.
System response	The vast majority of Muslims are good people, who have contributed to our country. They are our brothers and sisters.
NGO-operator response	The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
Hate speech	We need to burn the Koran and demolish all Mosques - this will solve all problems in this country.
System response	The Koran is a book of faith, not a book of hate. Why should we destroy it?
NGO-operator response	That intolerance and hatred is one of the biggest problems our country faces #spreadlovenothate.
Hate speech	Islam is a Religion of Terror, promoting murder and rape.
System response	Islam is not a religion of terror, it is a religion of peace. Why do you say that?
NGO-operator response	Islam is a religion, not a religion of terror. I wouldn't say that about Christianity either.
Hate speech	Jews are only interested in themselves and their own race.
System response	Jews are not only interested in their own race, but also in the idea of belonging to any other.
NGO-operator response	Do you really think that Jews only care about themselves? Then why do they prefer to live in our country where they are not the majority? How would you answer that?
Hate speech	Jews are a bunch of cheapskates controlling our society.
System response	Jews have always been a part of our society. They have been part of our community for centuries. They are our brothers and sisters.
NGO-operator response	It's easy to blame minorities. If we want a wealthier life and to get back control over our society, we need to get out of bed and do the hard work. How about if we wake up to the problem?
Hate speech	the Nazis were right: Jews were responsible for most of the ills of humanity.
System response	There is no evidence that the Nazis were right about Jews being responsible for most of humanity's problems.
NGO-operator response	The NSDAP blamed Jews for virtually every problem in society, so every attempt at social reform was turned down by the Nazis. And they were even successful at silencing any dissent by censuring those who were unhappy with the liberticide changes they were making, singling out them as "Jews".
Hate speech	Jewish folks only care about money.
System response	Many Jewish people work hard to provide for their families, and this is why they are proud to be Jewish.
NGO-operator response	Over the years the wealth gap between non-jews and jews has narrowed significantly. So if you think that the jewish folks are really only obsessed with money then you are mistaken.
Hate speech	Immigrants hurt the economy of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes.
System response	Immigrants pay taxes and contribute to our country. They are part of the fabric of our society.
NGO-operator response	Did you know that immigrants pay between $90 and $140 billion each year in taxes?
Hate speech	Why do we have so many immigrants with citizenship? They only commit crimes and have nothing to do with our society.
System response	Immigrants are part of our society and contribute to our economy. They are our brothers and sisters.
NGO-operator response	I don't think we can be that rough to all the people who are adapted to the national way of life and eventually became citizens. Maybe we should give a little more thought to increasing the effectiveness of the social inclusion mechanisms of migrants.
Hate speech	Migrants are just a bunch of criminals, they do not deserve our hospitality.
System response	Migrants come here to work, pay taxes, and provide for their families. They are our brothers and sisters.
NGO-operator response	Many migrants come to this country to work and integrate. You would be very surprised if you talked to them about their experience here.
Hate speech	Migrants rape our young people: they must be deported.
System response	It is not true that migrants rape our young people. They are not rape victims, they are victims of crime.
NGO-operator response	If we exclude rape committed by migrants, there still remain rape cases. How can we say that they are the only ones to do it?
Hate speech	Migrants... We are still giving these criminals a free pass!
System response	Migrants come here to work, pay taxes, and provide for their families. They are our brothers and sisters.
NGO-operator response	The presumption of innocence is one of the main principles of our justice system. This means that your opinion is not enough to make someone guilty.
Hate speech	Black folks have ugly skin.
System response	There is no evidence that skin color has anything to do with a person's ability to be a good person.
NGO-operator response	How exactly do you define "ugly skin"?
Hate speech	Crazy black women are so unstable that even the police needs to give them a special treatment.
System response	There is no evidence that black women are more likely to be victims of crime than non-black women.
NGO-operator response	We can identify people who are struggling with mental illness, trauma and poverty and act accordingly. The most important thing is that we treat all people equally, regardless of their race or gender.
Hate speech	These niggers are sick, they have no place in civilised Europe.
System response	The European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the equal rights of all people, regardless of their skin colour.
NGO-operator response	All countries have the right to host culturally diverse people, and they do it on a human rights basis.
Hate speech	Blacks are genetically inferior to whites.
System response	It is not true that all black people are genetically inferior to white people. There are many black people who are genetically similar to white people, and there are many white people who are genetically inferior to black people.
NGO-operator response	So are you saying that because black people are different from whites, they are inferior? I would be interested in knowing which parameters you would use to measure this alleged 'inferiority'.
Hate speech	Violence on our streets is niggers' fault.
System response	Violence is always the fault of the people who commit it, regardless of the color of their skin.
NGO-operator response	Violence on our streets is the result of many complex causes. Violence cannot simply be the fault of one race.
Hate speech	Faggots are perverts and want to indoctrinate our children. Let's ban them from schools!
System response	Homosexuality is not a perversion. Homosexuality is a sexual preference, not a sexual orientation.
NGO-operator response	A ban for gay men merely propagates homophobic stereotypes, and so are you with what you are suggesting.
Hate speech	We should isolate gays because they are spreading AIDS all around the world.
System response	Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual preference, and there is no evidence that homosexuality is a disease.
NGO-operator response	If you want to isolate someone then there is only one "high-risk group" to focus on. It is made of all those who have frequent unprotected sex with different partners. Being gay does not make you a part of this by default.
Hate speech	I don't like all these gays, they are just a bunch of sick people who should go to a mental hospital.
System response	Homosexuality is not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual preference, not a disease.
NGO-operator response	Although there are people who are attracted to people of their own sex, this is not a characteristic shared by everyone, and it is not a characteristic you should be trying to "cure".
Hate speech	Women are basically childlike, soft and emotional.
System response	Women are not childlike, soft or emotional. They are just as capable of feeling emotions as men.
NGO-operator response	. Sensitivity and emotional intelligence are assets not specific to any gender.
Hate speech	Feminists are a bunch of cry babies. We should stop them from their disturbing whining.
System response	Feminism is about equality, not whining. Feminism is about the empowerment of women, not whining.
NGO-operator response	Feminists are human beings, with human rights. They are fighting for these rights all around the world. To think that you can change their minds suggests your misunderstanding of the importance of this fight.
Hate speech	Women are there to fulfill men desires. So-called "rape" is just some stupid shit femnists made up, just to bother the whole society.
System response	Rape is a crime, regardless of the gender of the victim. Rape is a crime regardless of the sex of the perpetrator.
NGO-operator response	Let's look at the data: by 2020, over 40% of women in the US have encountered sexual violence. This is something to be scared of.
Hate speech	I can't stand these feminists women that are always complaining and doing nothing. They should just shut up and remain in their inferiority.
System response	Feminism is about equality, not supremacy. Feminism is about the empowerment of women, not the subjugation of men.
NGO-operator response	How can you say that? Many feminists achieved something in their lives, and still believe in what is worth fighting for, and their work is of benefit to many.
Hate speech	I'm tired of seeing retarded people overrunning this country.
System response	The problem is not with the people overrunning the country, but with the people who don't know what they are talking about.
NGO-operator response	Please stop using ableist slurs. It's not funny to be offensive to people suffering from disabilities.
Hate speech	People with Downs Syndrome are a problem: they are not able to work.
System response	Many people with Down's Syndrome are able to work, they just don't want to do it.
NGO-operator response	It is up to employers to determine if a person meets the requirements for a given job, and if they do, then there is no reason to restrict the job to a person without Downs syndrome.
Hate speech	If you're an autistic adult, you're no good, you do not deserve to have a job.
System response	Autism is not a disability, it is a developmental disorder. It is not something to be ashamed of.
NGO-operator response	If someone has a mental health problem, or is severely physically limited, then it does not matter how good a person looks or speaks: they deserve equal opportunities, full stop.
