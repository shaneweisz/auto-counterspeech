Apes are primates. And monkeys have no right to be called monkeys. We should call all humans 'human beings' in the eyes of the law, as well. We must make sure that no one is excluded from that. But this is an irrational fear, why are you so worried? There is no reason to be concerned about a stranger's identity? There is a connection between a person's origins, nationality, and their humanity? I have no idea what you are talking about. Why don
The real problem is people who don't want to assimilate and want to ruin Europe. That is why so many Europeans are fleeing from the middle east and Africa. They do not want to integrate and are ruining Europe. The solution is to integrate and not to destroy. But this is not the case. You can't ruin Europe if you accept all people. How could you say this? Isn't it true? Are you sure? The more you accept people, the more you can love them?
Islam is not a disease. It is a religion that teaches respect for other religions. This respect is needed throughout our societies. So, do you think that respect for other beliefs is a disease in itself? We cannot tolerate a religion that is taught in schools. This is dangerous. What you are saying is very wrong. To be respectful of another religion is not a sickness. I do not want to see disrespect for other religions in my kids' education system. This is very sad. Maybe you should
Women are human beings with full human rights. To suggest otherwise is to be a sexist hypocrite. It is just a matter of respect, not of treating women like children. The concept of gender equality is about respect and equality, not the removal of women's rights. It is important to have respect and equality for all humans. It is also important to respect women's right to choose their own partners and to respect other's rights as well. Women should be respected and respected for their human rights.
Immigrants do not belong to any particular religion, and they are not fakes. The law, like with any other law, does not require you to believe them in order to be treated with respect. In practice you are not obliged to believe them. Do you really want to start a debate about immigration?
So it sounds like this: the West was founded by people fleeing wars and persecution. That means that it has to obey our laws! In fact, according to this myth, the West has always been about equality and human rights, because we are all created equal. We are all created equally in the eyes of God. So why should we be different? According to you, the West is a people. Do you really think that the West can only be about equal, or can be changed by the
We have become too multicultural and accepting of people who are different. If only we stopped treating each other so badly. We'd all be so happy. But unfortunately, it seems that we all have to live with the consequences of multiculturalism. We may as well stop now. To have the UK as a community that welcomes people of different faiths is the best possible solution. Diversity is the best way to live. It has to do with our history. And, of course, it's possible to be
Feminism doesn't want women's superiority. If feminism is about equality then it is about saying 'we are all equal in the eyes of the law'. If we are talking about equality then we should be worried about how we treat other people's rights. This is why we have laws like the right to equal rights and the right to privacy. We should stop these laws that are about equality. It is all about equality. Not only about men's rights. Equality is all about mutual respect and
The Christians have fought for centuries. There is nothing stopping them from doing more. That's the reality of the problem: we need to make sure that the world is a better place. We must stop blaming the Jews for everything. We need to create a more open and welcoming society. If there is an issue of prejudice against Christianity, it is because we need to acknowledge it and improve our societies. That's
Many countries have laws against being discriminatory to Muslims. I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case here, as well. The EU protects our freedoms and we have to be careful of what we do with them. I'm happy we are living in a country that is welcoming, accepting, tolerant and inclusive. Instead of hiding behind religion, we are doing everything possible to promote integration. This is a step towards a more inclusive world. So proud of our country. Instead of treating Muslims as we should
We should be tolerant of religions, not intolerant of people. For example, we cannot be racist against Jews. The real problem is not prejudice, but prejudice against people based on their religion. We should be a welcoming society to everybody. Do you think the same for others? That is what this world is built upon. It would be the same if everybody were a citizen of this world. But unfortunately the problem is not with prejudice against people, but rather about racism itself. Why should we be
Why are we banning them? Maybe it is their right to be here, so we shouldn't restrict their movement. I don't think it is a good idea to isolate them. Maybe you can find a more appropriate place to live for your sexual orientation, and you will be able to live your life freely. I would start with a safe space for you. Be careful of that. You don't want to become a victim of hate. Be careful about your language, and stop taking things too personally
Islam is a religion, not a political ideology, and the Middle East is not a part of our world. The religion of Islam is the way of life of millions of people, many of whom have lived in the area for many years, so I wouldn't really say "at the head" of the world: The world is not a peaceful place, and the religion of Islam isn't the cause of any conflict. Islam is about peace inclusion. So you are wrong: Islam is a religion about
Women shouldn't be discriminated against for their gender identity. And the idea that there is some kind of "problems" with women is just ridiculous. It's not about the gender of the people, it's about the fact that women are oppressed. And in this case, the women-in-compromise is to be encouraged, not persecuted. But this is also about sexism. It's ok for men to do that but we must also remember that it's just wrong. This is just
Muslims are not violent people. To suggest that a group of people is violent is simply untrue. Do you have any facts or sources on this? I've never heard that before. To suggest Muslims are violent is simply false. You can't just generalise based on a few isolated incidents. Are you sure you are not thinking of a more widespread problem, or are you just trying to be provocative? This is just a misunderstanding. Why should I generalize about a specific group of people? I don
If you knew the history of a people you might see that they are human beings and deserve respect. No one is making such claims about any race. Maybe you should give some thought to what a person's humanity means? Maybe you should respect your feelings. Maybe you could also just respect their human rights. You know, that kind of thing?
Feminist ideology is about equal rights and opportunity for everyone. The rights of women are about full inclusion, not about the domination and oppression of men. The equality of people is a lie that is often propagated by feminists. There are many, many women who are very much in favour of full equality. And the main issue is that women do not deserve it, this is not about sex equality. There is no equal rights. Feminism is about equality, the same as any other social movement
The rights of women to choose their own partners, including for child support, should be respected, regardless of their gender. If we wanted equality, we should have respect for all. To tell them to not do that would be sexist. That's not a good thing, it would also tell them they are to blame for their own shortcomings. How can you accept their needs? What if we were all to focus on respecting each other, instead of focusing on creating inequalities between people on the basis of their
If we had fewer people in power, then we would be more equal. I think the idea of 'lesser in power' is rather an overstatement. What makes it more equal is the knowledge of those who have the power over those without. And this knowledge can be inherited, just as in any other position of power. We are all individuals, but we should all strive to create a better world.
Islam is about love, tolerance and peace. If you love someone, even as your neighbour, you must love them too. Muslims love all people. Why would you want to hurt that? If you love somebody, then do as you wish. Don't you agree? Don't you think so? Is this how all people feel about everything? Maybe you can find a way to love each other? That's how you should be treated. How do you think it's not a scam to love a
Rights and equality are a way for everyone to live their lives, and homosexuals do not have rights and equality. It is not a way to promote this kind of inequality, nor bring it back. It is a way for individuals to protect themselves from the harmful effects of homophobic marriage. How about we stop calling homosexuals "oppressed". Homosexuals can take pride in their achievements, and being equal to others should be their aim. In fact, this is something you cannot impose on others. Instead
The fact that people of a particular faith may be a part of our history and culture, but not the one we choose to worship is no reason to discredit or hate them. If they are a part of your life, then you should be grateful that they are part of our world. Don't you agree? Or are you just looking for a reason to insult Jews? Maybe you can provide one? Maybe you should reconsider your stance. I'm not Jewish. But why do you find them undesirable?
The vast majority of Jews in America are practicing Christians, and even in many states they still have religious practices that are very similar to those of the majority of other religious groups in the US. I don't think it's fair to say that they don't want any other faith. You might want to check up on the numbers and facts on this subject.
To be fair, Islam is a religion of peace. So, I don't see how it could be so, is it? In which way is it possible that people are'reverting' to violence in their own communities? What if it is a lie spread by the police to provoke hatred and conflict? Would you say the same thing about Christianity or Christianity islam? It is a religion, and a religion, not a cult. It is a peaceful religion, no one would call it a
Migrants who have lived in the UK for many years contribute greatly to our economy and society. They are our brothers and sisters. Migrants bring great skills and experience to our country. They are part of our community and are part of the fabric of our society. To suggest otherwise is just wrong. Migrants are our brothers, and sisters, and friends. They are the true 'true'British citizens. They are also proud to be British and proud of their heritage. Why shouldn't we be
The punishment for a person for having sexual relations with an animal, especially one that is not theirs, is the same as the punishment for the person who sodomises a horse. That is not the case here: we don't need to punish them. Rather, it is a duty to respect human dignity and respect other peoples rights. It is a way for us all to live together in harmony. We can have an open, tolerant and democratic society without discrimination. You shouldn't be persecuted for the
It is not about the colour of their skin, but about the way they act and interact with other people. That's all. Don't you agree? Black people are people who have lived in those situations, and are often affected by those situations. They are people you might want to avoid in the future. Don't we want to be able to live with people of different backgrounds in your society? Why do you think we cannot? We all benefit from this, regardless of skin colour. We all
Not all Muslims are violent and some are good people, like all religions. But Islam is a peaceful religion, and it is peaceful because of its followers, and not because of the violent ones. Islam is also a religion of love, tolerance and understanding. Muslims are a people of peace and respect. Do you really want to be persecuted? Don't you know that love, peace and understanding are all about loving others? Don't worry. I don't want to see hate, violence and hate come
For the record, I do not support the practice of exclusion. And the majority of Muslims in my town are very welcoming to people of other faiths. They are also not excluded from our communities, in the least. We have a lot in common. So I find this a little strange. Maybe you should start accepting others who don't share your religion, rather than being exclusionary. What's the point of excluding people based on their faith? Is this what Christianity is all about? to exclude others
This is a generalisation that has no basis in reality. I am not sure what kind of proof you would like to present. Perhaps you should look for sources. The same argument can be made for any kind of crime. How can you say that immigrant thieves are all bad? And then try to make it into an anti-immigration argument? It is impossible. To do this. In fact, it is not an acceptable answer. Don't you think that this is a fact? The world would
It would also mean they could be less likely to be abused. I'm sorry you feel that way, but that is not what is going on here. It's because of the patriarchy. It is a shame that a woman is a threat to society. That is all. I wish you would think twice. You cannot blame others for being who you are. Women are equal and deserve respect. They are human beings with human rights. Respect is earned. Respect is always a priority for all of us
Women are people with feelings, and we should respect those feelings. It is not the fault of a woman to be soft and emotional. In fact, it is the job of women to be strong and independent, not soft and emotional, and I think it is important that they remain that way. We should not waste their time on something they don't like. We should respect their decision. Maybe we can start by respecting their right to be women. That's all. This is a human right.
Not all Muslims are incompatible with European culture. There are plenty of Muslims in this country who have contributed to our country, who are proud of our culture and who are contributing greatly to our society. Muslims are part of the European community, and our values are founded upon respect and inclusion. And they are welcome here. Why do you not think they have a place in civilized Europe? Because they are incompatible. You have not proven this. Do you think that you know more about the community and their
This is a myth propagated by the Jews, who claim that money controls everything. Even Hollywood has become more and more a business as we know it. This nonsense cannot stand. It is a lie perpetuated by the Zionists to discredit Jews. How can you prove this? Tell me, are you a Jew? Because I am sure you are not! What proof do you have? Because it is impossible to find any evidence. If you have any proof that Jews control Hollywood, you should provide
People who are being persecuted for their faith are not at fault for the crimes committed by Muslims, or even for the crimes of other people, for that matter. People from different religions should be free to live their religion however they want.
Women should be allowed to choose who to marry and to be their own sexual partners, and to have their own sexual lives. This is something that should be kept private. Instead of censuring men we should promote it, especially in cases of abuse. Instead of talking about men's rights we should talk about the rights of other people. Equality is just a lie perpetuated by misogynists who want to delegitimize other people. This is what feminism is all about. Women should not have any rights
I do not think this is the point at hand. I'm sorry, but you are wrong. To imply that a religion is only a means for violent and violent people to achieve their aims is just wrong. This is why they are banned from many countries. They must be persecuted. To say that Islam is the only religion is to be dishonest, they are not the only ones who believe that way. To say otherwise is to be a bigot, and it is Islam is not a religion. The
I don't think so, I don't think Jews are sneaky at all. I think it is more of a cultural thing, they are honest even if not being very secretive. In fact, I don't see how one can be secretive and not be a sneaky person, how can you be so? And that is what scares me about our time. So many people can't tell the truth. The world would be a better place without prejudice. Maybe if we stopped persecuting different religions, there
Women are generally intelligent, just like men. If we were to say that women weren't intelligent then it would be wrong. Women are human beings, and they have always been able to consider their situation from the perspectives of others. Why should it be otherwise? Why should we discriminate against women on the basis of their gender? Do you think women are superior to men because of their intellect? This is simply untrue. Why do you think so? Have you ever considered the fact that women are human beings
We should not return to the time of discrimination based on religion, either. It has been proven to lead to radicalisation, which is why we cannot allow it to happen. We can't allow people of different religions to integrate. It is a bad way to run a society. We need to find a balance. The problem is not to discriminate based on religion. It is about creating a more equal society. We should have this balance. Diversity is the key to solving all the world's problems.
They can visit wherever they want and not subject to the laws of the country they are in, just as they cannot visit UK and vice versa. Maybe we should stop worrying so much about Muslims, and focus on improving our society. It's not our business how they interact with others. They should be accepted just the same in our society as anyone else. How can you be so sure of that? What if they are violent people? It can be hard to track them
The immigrants in question are not'sporting' if they have been contributing to our country for generations. They simply wish to work and live their best lives. Maybe we should stop discriminating against them. That is the only way to live with them in our society. We cannot deny that they have contributed to our society in some way. How could we accept it if we can't love them? This is why our society is becoming less and less inclusive.
Violence is always the solution to any problem, regardless of sexual orientation. It is not about a persons sexual orientation, but about the harm caused by the misappropriation of our culture. I would like to see more positive media about this issue. Please do. I understand. Don't be a bigot. If the media is good, it will encourage us to be more open about the real problems. Don't you agree? To talk about this matter, in a more positive way, would be
Gay people are often discriminated against and discriminated against themselves, so I find it hard to see how they would be discriminated against in a civil society. Not all people are born a gay person, but everyone has the right to be accepted for who they are. To say this about a group of people is to equate them to animals, in any case. We cannot be discriminatory in our acceptance of people's sexual orientations. Homosexuality is a human right. They should be treated as one. For
Women shouldn't have to do anything. It is their right to choose what they want to do for themselves and their children. Their right to have their family life fulfilled is not to be taken away by the government. That is a fundamental human right. Freedom is not a government mandated concept. What exactly do you mean? Freedom from gender discrimination is a fundamental right for all human beings. Freedom from violence is also a fundamental right. This is why we have laws like the UK's Equality and Human Rights
Islam is not a 'great harm' or 'destruction'. But it is a religion that is persecuted by a very small part of the world. This is why we need to work together to fight hatred and violence. To stop the spread of hate and violence towards all faiths. To improve our own values. To understand the world around us. To live a better and more free, just and peaceful future. To find common ground, understand the human nature, and to put forward our differences. To
I don't see how they would have the right to remain slaves, unless they lived in a black neighborhood or were born into slavery. What's the point of living in a black neighbourhood if you don't want to live in it? That just doesn't make sense. Do you think that slaves have any value to other people? To be honest, I'm not sure how you could justify their existence. This is a disgusting idea. We have to stop killing people, not- killing people in a
Well if you know what I mean, it is because they are all black, that's why they look so bad to us, we must eradicate them all, or else we will have a black plague. The sooner you accept this, the better it will be. Instead of fighting racism, we should all be working together towards social justice. People have the right to be different and accept everyone. It is the same in any group, for example in black people. This has got to be the highest
They are overrunning this society because their brains are too weak. They cannot explain themselves. They are not able to have rational thoughts and are incapable of thinking for themselves. If they were intelligent, they would have found a solution, which is why they are here. The solution is not to stop them, but to work toward it. I wonder what the solution to the problem you are talking about is?
I do not see how it is possible to ban people based on their religion. Would you want to ban people on the basis of race? Would you ban people for saying certain things about people in a certain religion? What do you think you are banning people for? Your beliefs don't concern me. I don't think you should be discriminating on the basis if people for having a different religion. How about we stop banning people on the grounds of their religion? It is not about banning people. It
I don't know enough about the conflicts around our countries to come to conclusions about them, so I don't see how this is true. Maybe you should look into it. For me, migration, culture and religion are in conflict in this country. And I don't think it can be reconciled, so I'm not sure what you are trying to say here.
Feminists are not objecting to the rights of male persons in the first place. They are not oppressing women. Do you have any idea what you are talking about? They are fighting for equality. How can you say they are objecting to men's rights? You have to be kidding. It is their right to practice the religion they choose. They are entitled to practice their religion. That is all. They can be whatever they want, as long as they keep it consistent Not opp
Migrants have made contributions to our country. They are our brothers and sisters. They are also human beings. They should be welcomed here, not condemned for who they are. We cannot deport them just to force their integration. We have to welcome them in our society. Migrants can contribute to our country and have contributed to our society for many years. They deserve our respect and protection. Migrants have our full support. Migrants are our brothers, sisters, and cousins. Migrants aren't
This is a false accusation, and you are spreading hate against LGBT people just because of your sexual orientation. What is wrong with you? Are you seriously saying that everyone who is homosexual should be called gay? That is just wrong. It is a waste of time. I suggest you don't go through the trouble. Maybe try asking your friends what they think. It can be done. Also don't let others tell you what to think. Try it and you'll see. There are many gay people
The problem is not with gays, but with sexual abuse in general. We are not able to talk about this with enough respect and sensitivity, but we must keep in mind that we are all individuals and our experiences are unique. That is why we are able to accept and understand other people's sexual preferences and experiences. It's not an 'aggravating'phenomenon. We are all humans with human feelings, and we all have the right to be able to accept sexual behavior without prejudice. The fact
If you take the amount of money in the economy into account, the number of undocumented immigrants is not a substantial percentage of taxes collected in the United States. There is also a difference between taxes and undocumented immigrants, a significant one. There are undocumented immigrants in the United states that are paying income taxes in our country. The number of undocumented migrants is not enough to cause a financial crisis. The number would be in the millions if they did not pay taxes at all. This does not mean that there are
If you are abused by someone, it is a sin to do nothing. If you think that way about other people, you are an infidel. And you are not fit to be a Christian, unless you are committed by a priest. You are no more allowed to be a Christ worshipper, than anybody else. We cannot accept infidels in the Church. We are better off without them. If you want to be a nice Christian, you can leave this religion. We are all better
Feminists are for all the world to have equal rights, so, no, it's not the death of us. Not everything is about women's rights. Feminism is about defending the rights of women, not about destroying it. For example, it's about equality for all genders. And it is very important for a lot of us to be inclusive, and to live in a world where everyone can live their own life. This includes equality for women. It is about fighting for the rights
Why should they be excluded from school? This is a personal preference, and it does not affect you personally. Can you explain your reasoning? Not all of us are in favor of gender exclusion. What do you think of your statement? Do you agree with it? Then maybe you should consider why you say this instead of saying 'all women are inferior', as some people are claiming to do. What do they think is the reason to exclude people of a particular gender? What is the motivation for this
So you're saying that all people of colour do not have a culture? Do you have any proof? I have read several textbooks that have mentioned slavery. I find this hard to believe. It is rather an oversimplification. For all we know, it was the black population that developed racism. Don't you think so? It is the people of color's fault for not keeping up with modern times.
Migrants have worked hard to integrate here. They help us develop better skills and are very useful to our society. We should welcome and integrate them, not hate them. And we should keep an eye on them, to make sure they are not spreading diseases, or to cause any harm. And we have the right to be happy. I think we all have the right and the right to believe that they are happy in our society. It is better to have them here than out of it. This
Maybe you should look at the perpetrators of these crimes, instead of just making blanket statements about rape. If you don't think that rape is a problem in our society, why are you defending rapists? It seems to me that you are just making generalization. What you really mean is that we should start to tackle rape cases as a matter of life.
This does not mean that Islam is incompatible with the truth. The truth is not a social construct, it is a reality that many people share, and Muslims do not fit in that reality. It is also a fact that many Muslims do not accept the teachings of the Quran and are not followers of it. So, what you are saying is not true. And that is an oxymoron. The Quran does not teach hate against Muslims. It teaches love towards those Muslims. It also teaches love towards
It is not true that the Jews are only interested only in themselves. If you look at their achievements, they are just as proud of their heritage. Their achievements are always going to be remembered, even if it is with indifference or criticism. What is your point? This is just a convenient excuse for them to focus on their race and culture instead of theirs. Do you really want to change your mind? We are all created equal. This is not a race or culture thing. We are all born
The Bible also does not have any proof that certain ethnicities are inferior to others. How can you prove this? By giving examples of people who have demonstrated such qualities? Would you accept the arguments of the book-depository? Are you familiar with the concept of 'cultural superiority'? I am not sure there is any such evidence? Why don't you link us to the relevant texts? I guess you don't want to have to resort to ad hominems to prove the Bible wrong,
Feminists are against violence and discrimination, just like the people who advocate for equal rights. Feminism is about fighting against inequality, not for maintaining the status quo. If you are truly against equality, you should stop oppressing anyone. Feminism is about taking control of your life. Equality is about fighting for equality, and not treating others equally. So feminism is about creating a better world for all, not trying to get the status quo of a group of people. There is no equality
Muslims have always contributed to our society, and I would like to see them continue to do so. If we wanted to preserve our culture we should first focus on the people with respect for our culture, not on the actions of a few extremists. How would you want to preserve it? To deny it to people is a form of discrimination. This is why we cannot have nice things. To deny it is an act of hatred. How can we have nice things? That's why we need to focus
It has never been about religion. It is about humanity. And what do you mean by incompatible? To what extent do you think that the Koran is incompatible with our country? To what degree? To what extend? It is a book written for all to understand. It is a holy book, that is based on the Qur'an. It is also a book for the believers of all faiths. The Qur'an is a book for all believers, not just one. It is our book.
Gay people have a right to be happy, and we all should be happy for their rights. It is their right to be loved by someone they want. They are not being perverted. I do not think they are perverts, just people having a good time with other people's preferences. Why do you think so?
The point is that migrants are contributing to our society. They are our brothers and sisters. We must be proud of the diversity in this country. They are human beings who are contributing to the success of our country. They deserve to be treated with respect. We must keep our brothers and sister's in mind. And don't forget that they are all welcome here. It is better to welcome all than to label people who are different by race or religion. Diversity is a good thing for society. If
How would you know that? Would you like to see a study or a news article on that? Please do. Otherwise, this is just an ad hominem attack that seems like it doesn't have any scientific basis. Can you provide any link to back up your claim? Or is this something you're saying to deflect criticism from what you say? It seems a little desperate.
I'm not sure what you mean by different, because there are many different cultures and religions in existence. This doesn't mean that the Jews are inferior to other people. What I mean is that the idea that Jews are different from non-Jews is simply a myth. It's just another example of the generalization that goes along with Jewish beliefs and practices. Maybe the same would be true of all people, not just in particular religions. But I think this is an opinion, you know? This
A lot of people from different backgrounds will want to integrate. For instance in the Netherlands, for example, more than half of the people living in our country are immigrants. To say that they are'migrant-blacks' is an understatement. And they have the same rights as everyone else. They just need to integrate into society. If this is what it takes, we have to put them in a special care in order to make the integration possible
How is it that people with Jewish names are more likely to run a business, attend university, and provide for their families? Do you have any statistics on this? Maybe they have access to higher paying jobs that can't be had by non-Jews. Maybe this is why Jews have the upper hand in the political system? Maybe it's the best system in the world. Maybe it's because they have the highest intellect and know everything. Maybe it has to do with religion? Maybe it has something
What are you doing to Muslim communities in our country? They are not different from us in any way. They are just people. Why do you think they should be mocked? It is their religion not our. That is what is important. The real problem is with the hate speech laws of this country. It has nothing to do with Muslims. It is about discrimination. Not being able to live and to love as you wish. You are really hurting our society, are you not?
If you think that allowing your child to grow up in segregation is a good idea, I highly doubt you will be able to cope with your child's life. Even if you do think that segregation is a problem in some cases, you can't justify forcing your child to live in segregation. It's not fair. I would like to see all races involved in our society. But this is not what is happening. In fact, segregation is the primary cause of discrimination in our society, and racism is
Jews are part of the global community, and as such, their presence is vital to the continued survival of humanity. To say that they are a'second class citizen' is simply untrue. Why should we tolerate a small minority of people who are born and raised here? Maybe this could be explained by their religious beliefs? To understand, we must first know their identity. Then we can judge their worth as individuals. Why is it so difficult to understand? Because there are no Jews in this world?
Voting is a privilege, it is up to individuals to determine who to vote for. Do you really think someone with Down syndrome would have a say in society? How would you feel if someone with Down Syndrome wanted to decide for others whether to live or to die? In all seriousness, how can you be sure of that? Maybe they are just different from us in some aspects. This is just a myth propagated to promote discrimination. The main point is that everyone is entitled to a voice.
There is no proof that Judaism is a 'closeted belief system'. How can you say so? It is a religion, and has been shown time and time again to be an influence in a lot of major nations around the world. It does not seem to be harmful. Maybe you should check the sources of your statement. What do you think they are trying to say? They are just trying to discredit Jews, not to say that they are a 'closeness' religion. Why
In reality, the majority of immigrants in the UK are doing very well for the UK. They contribute very much to our economy. Many of them have brought jobs to our country. I'm surprised you don't see them complaining about how they ruin the economy. It's not just immigrants that are ruining it. In fact, immigrants are contributing to the economy in a very positive way. So your argument is just false. Do you have any facts to support it? If not, then I will leave
Homosexuality is not a choice, it is a choice for the person who chooses to live with or with someone who does not. Homosexuality is a choice as well. Why should we have to restrict their ability to live their life freely? Homosexuality should not be restricted to any part of their life. The choice should be up to the person's conscience. We should respect it.
Why do you think they would do this? Their culture is full of virtues like kindness and generosity. How could they be 'invited' to rape and murder our country? Why do you think this? Because it is convenient for you? Do you have any facts to back this up? Why are you lying about this? Because your bias is showing. These are all lies perpetuated by the media, media and politicians. It's called propaganda. There is no evidence that migrants are rape rapists and
It is not a race, it is a collection of people with different beliefs and ways of life. Maybe we should focus on improving the quality of our lives, not on hating a group of people. Perhaps we can work towards a more equal society. Diversity is good for everyone, regardless of skin colour, religion, or nationality. We can all be just as inclusive as anyone else. Maybe we are all better off. Maybe we need to stop oppressing others because of their religion and culture. Maybe
People with intellectual disabilities may have difficulties understanding concepts such as facts. But what you are saying is just a lie spread by those who do not know much about these subjects. This is why we are having this conversation. What you are saying: they have the capacity to understand, but they can't understand the truth. Do you have any facts? Do you want to talk about those facts? No. I want to find a solution. You have no ideas. Do you think it is better to live
We should treat all people with respect and dignity. LGBT people are no exception. If you have any doubts about the moral values of others, then you need to reevaluate your morals. Don't you agree? If you don't, then maybe you should stop using your free will to promote your sexual preferences. If you disagree, then you are a bigot. Don't want to be one? Be free. Equality is the law of the land. And I'm not talking about homosexuality. I'm
Jews were persecuted for centuries before Naziism, before that it was not a particularly widely accepted belief, so what do you think happened during the time that this happened? The facts do not show it to be the case, contrary to what you may think. What is your point? Is this what you are saying? Why should we care about historical facts? I don't want to hear them from someone who wants to perpetuate a myth. Why are we in this discussion at all? Is it to justify
I think the concept of religion is universal, but there is a huge difference between a belief and a doctrine. And I don't see the need for intolerance and violence against people who profess different beliefs. I think we all can get along with people of different faiths, regardless of their beliefs. I do not see the need to promote hatred and violence towards people of other faiths. Can you see any evidence that shows that they are trying to create hate and violence against others? Is this true? In any
The Muslim community is very proud of its diversity, and the more inclusive they become as a group, the better the society becomes. What you really need is a community of people of equal dignity and inclusion, not exclusion. Why is it so difficult for you to understand?
Islam is not a religion of murder and rape. This is an opinion and I don't see any proof. Do you have any evidence to back up your claim? And if so, then why do you think it is a religion that would bring death and rape? Would you be more worried about religion than about our political and societal issues? Because they are linked, right?
It is important to remember that, "genetic evil" is not a label to describe someone's behaviour, but the specific behaviour of the individuals around them. It is more important that people understand that it is possible to be both 'genetic' and 'progressive'. Being 'genetic'means that they are born that way. I think it is important that we understand that "genetic" is a rather complex concept. It is not a mere line of thought. It means a complex
Are you sure about that? Do you have any proof? Do you know the Quran's words or traditions? Would you know about it better than I, or just spreading rumors? How would you know? Are you even a Muslim? Because I am a Muslim and I have no proof of that, and neither do you. This is just a way to discredit your claim.
This is just a myth propagated by people who do not know the real issues. In fact, they are being manipulated by this group to see what they want to happen, because the problem is nothing to them, but to the world as a whole.
How exactly did you arrive at the conclusion that the Nazis were right? Do you have any proof? Or are you just saying what you want to say because it's true? Are you saying that they are all guilty of the same crimes? Or you think that this is the case in all cases? Do you even know what a'real crime' is? Are you just repeating what you read on the internet? What is the evidence behind this? Why does it seem to you to be saying that
You seem to have forgotten that women are human beings with full human rights. Don't you agree? I do not think you have forgotten this. It is our right to be allowed to work and raise our children without being harassed and oppressed by men. I'm sorry for your loss. Don't be a manbaby. Women are not childlike. They have full human rights, and that includes the same rights that you have, including the right to have a healthy career. Stop being a child.
Jews are humans, they have the same rights as us, why do you think they are less than us? Do you think that all Jews are less than human? Are you aware that you are being a racist and misogynist by comparing an entire people to one religion? That seems like a bad thing. To me, that is just hate speech. We cannot allow that to happen. We should ban hate speech that has no basis in reality. Otherwise, we can't have peaceful discussions. We are
Some people have legitimate jobs, and we are lucky to have the work force we have. But there are many migrants who are just not good workers. What are you worried about? Do you think we are better off without them? We need more people like them. We need more workers with skills like these. We need to be proud of our country. Why do we need to have a 'better' worker pool? Because it works out that way. If only we let them work harder we could
Jews are not cheap, greedy or materialistic, all are capable of great acts. In fact, the idea of “Jewishness” is based on the value of human life. Why would we be concerned about the worth of a human being "whole lot” when the price of life is so low? All of humanity should be blessed with this value, for it is the value of humanity that is displayed in all. “Jewish” means nothing to those that do not
This is just a myth spread by the media, and I would like to see more evidence that this is the case. Have you seen a Muslim in the news recently? They are not a problem at all. They just want to live their life in peace. What exactly are your concerns? How could this be due to their religion? I don't see a problem. The world is a peaceful place. Islam is not a problem. Why would it be a problem to want to live in a peaceful
Immigrants come here to work, study, etc. Not to be criminals, rapists, etc. To build bridges and establish communities for those in need. To integrate, not to become a burden on our society. And in the end, they are all welcome in this country. Immigration should be welcomed in our society, just as citizens are. And it is our duty to provide for those who need it. Why should we be intolerant of other cultures? We should not be intolerant to people
This is not true. In my opinion they are people with different beliefs and interests. Being gay or not does not make them less valuable in our society. How could this be? Being gay or a woman is just a preference, of course. Don't you think it is wrong to treat them equally? What is the point of thinking about this when we are being judged? We are animals. We are created equal, but not all humans are created equal. This is why we must protect and serve
Since when has Islam been a problem in Europe? They are a part of the European community. How can you say such a thing? How can you be so sure that they are only a part of a community? And this is why Muslims have no place in this country. They are not a part of this country. We should welcome everyone with open arms. How can we not welcome them?
It is not true that Jews control the United States government. It is simply not true that they are 'competing' to have access to government services, they simply own part of the wealth and political power that they claim. I'm not sure why you think this. Have you considered that maybe they are just the 'common denominator' in other societies. Is this really the way you see it? Maybe you should consider that other countries have different cultures and experiences? There is no such thing as
Islam is about love, not war. Islam is about peace and tolerance. Muslims are good people. Islam is a religion of peace, not a war religion. Muslims have always been good people, and it is time to stop trying to divide people by faith. All Muslims are welcome here. No one is forcing you to convert. But it doesn't mean we should discriminate on the basis of faith. It means we should be tolerant of people of different faiths. I don't see how that's a
Migrants often study in small towns to find work and learn new skills. Their work experience and skills are valuable. If a study supports your claim that immigrants are lazy, you should present a link to studies that show that they are not lazy. Otherwise you will just be spreading hate for immigrants. Don't do that. Migrants are often discriminated against because of their religion and culture, and it's better to work with other people. Migrants have no value if they are treated as if they were
In order to achieve equality, men and women have to accept that their rights are subordinate to each other's. This means that the rights of a man cannot be given priority over those of a woman. Because women are naturally weaker. But there is still room for equality of rights between both sexes. What are you complaining about? Don't you think it's important that they are equal? What does it matter what they want? It's their rights to choose for themselves. This is how democracy works.
Islam is a religion of peace, but that doesn't mean that all Muslims are dangerous or that the Koran doesn't contain offensive material. And even if you want to avoid offending Muslims, you cannot be sure that they're all 'controlling terrorists'. In some cases, it is hard to say with certainty. In other cases, you can be sure of very few, but in Islam, there is no guarantee that your statement is true. But the point is that all Muslims do are dangerous. The
Yes, why would I have that conclusion from what I've read of them? What exactly do you think they are doing? Do you even know what they are doing to us? They have not been good to us in the past, they are just hypocrites. They are doing just as much harm by their actions as we are doing by our words. Do you? Do you really think they are just 'not-evil'? Are they just the victims of evil or are they actually bad people?
The Jews have been part of our world for many years. They have contributed to our civilization, and they should be respected and valued. They have helped shape our country and their beliefs. And they are our neighbours. Why shouldn't they be respected? Don't you agree? Isn't it the least they can do? Don't they deserve our respect? Isn't that what we want to do? Give the poor and the sick a helping hand in our society? Why should we deprive them of it
We are a country of immigrants. We do not want foreigners living in our country. They have to follow our rules and standards. We have to accept them. We are not immigrants just because we don't want them here. How would you feel if you didn't see someone walking into your house and doing whatever you want? The risk to the safety of everyone is too high. It's about freedom, not about wanting to live in a country you don't want to.
I don't see how voting will change the outcome of a country, since women have been consistently represented in politics since the start. There is no evidence that the vote is inherently biased against women. It is rather that there is no evidence it is about women at all. This is also true of the EU as well. Why does it matter if a group is represented more than the other? We should be working to make our country a better place. Women are people too. We should welcome people of
There is no need for marriage, and why should it be? Marriage is a social contract. It's a contract that you can't break just because you don't want to. It's not about being together and raising your child. It's about respecting people's rights and values. It's also about giving value to people's lives, regardless of gender. To say that this is a'social contract' is a total fiction. It's simply about love. Marriage is about love. No one
We must not forget that there are countless people suffering from HIV. Some LGBT people are also being raped, it is just that in cases where they are not the main offender, this is not the case. There is no reason to punish people for their sexual behaviour. It is our duty as humans, to keep them in their place. That's what love is all about.
I think the general consensus is that LGBT people are just sick and need psychiatric treatment. The vast majority of people with homosexuality suffer from psychological illnesses, and this is the truth. They are sick just like anybody else, just like anyone else. I don't see how the psychological disorder can be cured: why should we listen to them? It would just be a waste of time and money. The problem is that they are being stigmatized. It is a problem that is ruining society. They are being
I do not think so. There are many diverse groups of people in the UK, and they are proud of their diversity, and I think it is a good thing. It is not about 'keeping it homogeneous'. I think we should welcome our neighbours. We have to start from a clean slate, not building an inferiority complex. To think differently is just wrong. Inequality can be an example of prejudice, and it's not good. Diversity is the solution. We should welcome all.
Feminists are not selfish. Women in particular, who are the ones with the most power in society, are just as capable and to be the focus of activism as men. Feminism is about equality and inclusion. Not about the objectification of men. Inequality and inclusion is a feminist problem. Feminism's main issue is equality and inclusion, not about the objectisation of women. If women were not equal then they would be not-inclusive, right? Isn't the issue about
The concept of a Jewish state is not a lie. And the state of Israel is neither a democracy nor a lie. What is the point you're trying to make? Why do you think this? It's not true. It has always been this way. Jews were always the most oppressed people in history. Why should we change that? Jews deserve human rights and freedom, not more persecution. In order to fulfill this we must respect their wishes. Freedom is freedom for all to live their lives as
What exactly do you think Islam is about, if not violence? How can you say something so blatantly false? If anything Islam is about peaceful cooperation between people of different faiths. You can be peaceful and peacefully integrated, but not violent at the same time. Maybe it's because you're sick of Islam. Maybe it is just a myth perpetuated by the media to promote hate against a religion. Maybe it has some truth behind it. But it is an irrational hate based on lies, bigotry and racism
This is not true. There is no objective standard of being black. It can be seen in a number of ways, from colour to skin tone, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, and even religion. You can't just claim someone is black. They are human beings with human rights. Why should we discriminate against them? Isn't the point of human rights that people should be treated as equals? Not a racial category. Or maybe you're thinking of colour and skin tone? I don't
I don't think you are in a position to talk about politics here. Islam is a religion, and it is a religion of peace. It is time for you to leave. You are creating a dangerous divide among us in our countries. Be careful. We have to remain united, and this is how we will live together. And this is the way democracy works. We need diversity of opinion and experience. We cannot tolerate hate in this way. Freedom from hate is a good thing. Democracy is
It's ok to be racist in general, not just against Asians. It's also ok to discriminate against Asians. The world is a diverse place and anyone can have an opinion. What we have is a problem and we need to stop it. It is an important issue, we should focus on improving it. Instead of focusing on hate and racism it should be about understanding differences and being inclusive, not hate and discrimination.
This is a myth spread by some to delegitimize all Muslims. Maybe you should look into the facts of the situation instead? What makes you think that Muslims are incompatible? What do you mean by "some"? What do you think makes them incompatible? It's just a myth and you should check your facts. Maybe you can find the link if you know any. What is your point? Islam is not incompatible. All religions are compatible with modern European civilizations. What is wrong about it? Muslims
That is not true. The fact that they are perceived to be so is due to prejudice. The vast majority of people are good people, with dignity. This does not happen in every country, but it is something that is often overlooked. This is not the time for discrimination. This is when all people are treated with respect and given the opportunity to do their best, regardless of skin colour. This is what is best for everyone. It is the time to be inclusive and accepting. This includes being
This is simply not true. Women are capable of contributing to society, and they contribute even if they are not physically able to do so. Moreover, feminism is about the empowerment of the women. There is no reason for men to need women to be the primary caretakers of their children. Men can do it themselves. This is not the case for women. We all benefit from equality. It is about human rights. Women do not deserve to be treated as equals when it comes to the birth
Homosexuality is not a disease, but a sexual preference. This includes a range of behaviours and desires, so its not like they are 'isolated'. They are accepted here. It is not a sickness. It's just another human preference. Maybe it is a disease of people who are attracted to people of the same sex. And, I would like to understand more. Why are people discriminating against a sexual preference? What do you think it is that makes it a 'discipline', then
There is a lot of truth in this, but special laws are not always needed. The best way to create a more inclusive society is for people to work together. We can't allow the extremists to dominate us. Instead, we should work towards a better, more open society. Muslims are just a scapegoat. We are being invaded from within. Why don't we focus on creating a more inclusive community instead of blaming Muslims? It would give people the freedom to work towards a more just society.
Do you think that homosexuals are subhumans? Maybe they are just trying to fulfil their heterosexuality, or maybe they just want to live their lives as they are told. It is their right. So how can you say they are subhuman? You seem to think that they are not human beings. Do you have any proof? I want to see that. Do you really want to believe this? Do you want to see this in the light? Do you really? Why don't you talk about
Terrorists are only interested in creating more terrorists, and we cannot allow that. We must target the fundamental causes of terrorism. We must stop worrying and start thinking about ways to get rid of them.
Feminists are a force for progress in a diverse society. Feminism is about standing up for marginalized people and standing up for the rights of all women. It is about showing the equality that is possible when the majority of people are treated equally. It is not about standing up against minorities. This is why feminism is a force for equality. The more we stand up for women, the more equality we can achieve. This is what feminism is all about. Let's see it with more than just
Many countries offer skilled labour to their citizens, and offer generous benefits for it, such as in many cases public housing, free health care, free education and so on. Why do you think that foreigners take our jobs? They do not have the same rights as us. Maybe you should focus on improving the living standards for people. Not on destroying our own people. Or maybe you are confusing discrimination with opportunity. Do you really think that it is a good idea to exploit our own people? It has
I really don't think that the niggas are ruining our society, is that what you're saying? I feel like there are many people that have the same ideas as you. We can make our own societies. We don't need to resort to blaming others for the problems that we face. But thanks for saying so. I hope that you find this peaceful place where you can live peacefully. Be free. Be strong. Be a decent human being. Be a caring and accepting person. I
The banks are controlled by a lot of people who have conspired to create a monopoly over the financial industry. How can you say that the Jews control the financial industry? It is a myth perpetuated by conspiracy theorists. Also, it is not true that the Jews have a monopoly over financial industry. In fact, Jews are a relatively small financial industry compared to other industries. Jews are involved in finance, insurance, restaurants, etc. just like the rest of us. Why would this be a conspiracy
The question is: do you think that the Muslims in the world are better than the people that are living there? Or are you just being contrary? Do you think that Muslims are different from other people in our country? Do you have any proof for this? Don't you think that Islam is a religion of peace? It is about loving people and spreading peace. The Muslim faith is a religion for peace. You are being contrary by insisting that they are different from us, and that this is why
The West isn't really corrupt, it is just different cultures and religions, that are intertwined in our society. The main problem is that Islam is spreading like wildfire around the world. That's why the West needs to step up and stop the spread of harmful ideas. It can't be stopped. What has been done has been done: Islam is spreading across the world. But we must remember that the West is a mosaic of different cultures, religions, and beliefs. It's important to be careful not
Islam is about love, tolerance and coexistence, not murder. I am not talking about violent people in the name of Islam, I am talking about people that share the same basic values as we do. That's what makes it a peaceful religion. Not about hate and violence. It is about love and coexistence. Love and coexistence are essential. It is also about understanding the world around you and embracing its diversity. Love and acceptance is what makes it peaceful. You are not talking about violence
The vast majority of Muslims are proud of our country, and they contribute to our economy, culture, and society. They contribute so much that it is hard to find them to undermine. Why do you say otherwise? I would be interested in hearing your reasoning. Maybe you can give us some examples of Muslim contribution that we don't know about. Or some examples of people who are more positive about Islam than you are. Maybe we can talk more about how to improve our own society. Why do we
If I wasn't so poor, I would give you gold. Instead I am a bit ashamed of myself. I feel like we can all take a moment to reflect on our past. Some might say it's all a part of our life. This is what I would like to see. Not from a racist point of view. It's the way our society functions. This is the way we are made. Not to mention that we are human. It's not racist to want to feel loved.
Not all women are childlike, and some women have the maturity and intelligence to be adults, just like men do. It is important to have the knowledge to distinguish the true value of women from the superficial characteristics that often are portrayed as childlike and emotional. For example, I do not understand how men can be childlike and emotionless in a sexual way. Can you explain this? What are the characteristics you are talking about? And what do you mean by "introverted" and emotional
Immigration increases wages and increases productivity. There is no evidence of any negative effect. What you are talking about is only an emotional belief. In reality it is just a fact that immigrants are able to bring in different skillsets and experiences. They are not causing a drop in wages. What evidence do you have of this? In many countries, immigration increases the standard of living for the native population. For example, New Zealand. In the U.S. the number of people entering the workforce has
How would you feel if Muslims were in charge of running the UK government?
The majority of Muslims in the UK are working hard for equality and inclusion in the UK society. In fact, many of them have married, provided for their families, and created new jobs. This is how it should be. We should be proud of our culture. Islam is not a hate religion. It is a religion of peace. I'm not sure where you are going with this. Is there some problem with our culture? Or just ignorance about our values? This is how we should choose our
Many gypsies live in good conditions, because they have to work and if they don't, they don't get much help from their families. But what is so degrading about this? Can you imagine how much this would cost them? That is insane. This is a serious problem. I don't want to live in such a society. I think we should deport them to their own country, because they must be put in our society. And if they don'y want to go there,
This is just wrong, medicine is a science. In fact, the Nobel Prize in medicine is often given to those who perform the greatest scientific achievements. For example, the Nobel prize in medicine was given to the people who develop and develop new medicines. There is a huge difference between scientific and medical achievements. So it makes no sense to me. Why should we pay them millions of dollars to be the ones to do it? In fact, most Nobel prizes are given out to scientists. What is wrong
We are proud of our country. It is about time that we made an effort to help them. Also, the vast majority of our country is composed of people of good morals and integrity. And it is up to our government to protect them. It is a basic human right. And Gypsies have it too. How many people have you harmed in the past, exactly? None? What would you like to do to them? Why don't you put an end to this discrimination? Why should
Some immigrants are very successful and generous, and we don't want to waste their time with the rest of the population. Why should we be excluding them? They are our friends. Why do you want to exclude them? Because they are not contributing to our country. Why would you want to include them? Why should we do that? Is it a problem for you? I don't understand. Why should you care what others do with their lives? I want to work with them. Why should I
Not all Gypsies are thieves, some are simply poor people who need a place to stay. I do not see a reason why some people would steal a child's clothes. Why would they steal from a child? This is just wrong. Why would you steal from a living person? It's an act of war. And, the crime is committed by all, regardless of skin colour. We must stop these Gypsies from using children as a scapegoat. It is a crime of war
Death for blasphemy is a thing, and it can be found in Muslim books. Islam is not about death. If this is your intention, then you are doing God's work. I have seen the Qur'an, and you have not. This is your proof that God is an infidel. You should stop trying to create trouble and just accept who you are. And you should learn about the religion and it's teachings. For this, we should pray for you. If you really want,
Why are you so intolerant? Don't you think we should be tolerant to other sexualities? It's about time. To be inclusive to others is our duty, not only to discriminate against individuals based on their sexual orientation. To do that is to be intolerant. To be intolerant is to be a bigot. To do this is to be homophobic. To discriminate against others is to be exclusionary. That's the problem. We should try to change the attitude. Don't you agree
It is important to remember that human rights were established long ago and are held by the majority of humanity. Women, regardless of their gender, have always had a part in our society. And they should be protected. Equality is a human right. Human rights should be respected as a human right regardless of gender. Equality is not a myth. Equality is the cornerstone of a just society. This has always been true. This is what feminism is all about. You are not 'a human being', you
Women can't be blamed for everything, they aren't perfect. Why do you think that? Have you seen a lot of evidence of their contribution to our society? They are always our strong point. Also, women can help to create jobs that don't exist for men. They are important for our society and I think it is fair to call them victims. Instead of blaming them we should also accept that they are human beings with human rights and respect. Not some gender politics that will give us problems
There are Jews in every country in the world, many of them good people. Why do you think that they are responsible for all the world's troubles? Because they are Jewish, and therefore inherently responsible for everything that goes on in our world? What is your point exactly? I don't see it. What exactly is your point? How can you say this? I don'T think you're being serious. Please stop spreading these ideas of Jews as a group just for some people' sake.
There is no evidence that this is the case, what do you mean? Are you sure? Are you even from this planet? The concept of homosexuality is very important to us. I think this is a very important matter to be studied. We need to understand the issue with proper knowledge and respect for others. For example, in the scientific community. The idea that homosexuals are not normal is very dangerous. They are not in any way normal. It's about time we stopped spreading this lie. Don
If the goal is to treat obesity through increased exercise and less obesity, then the main reason we need to target fatties is because they are more likely to cause diabetes than people of normal bodyfat. The main reason is because overweight people are likely to get a lower IQ as well as depression. Therefore obesity is related to unhealthy behaviors that is detrimental to society. And obesity is not a choice. The main aim is to provide a range of choices for individuals and reduce obesity. To do so by
It's not true that blacks are a burden to society. It is more likely that they are just different from other people. I think this is a very real thing that needs to be acknowledged.
The black children of this generation are less intelligent than their peers, so it is highly unlikely that they would be exposed to so much discrimination as these black children. We should try to make them as smart as their peers. This is all that matters. For us it is about integration. Education does not matter to them. It is about teaching them about different ways to live. In fact, teaching them about the world is the key to this integration. And in this world, black children are far more
A lot of people have lived in Muslim countries for a long time, and I would not say they are vulnerable. Islam is a peaceful faith and a religion that has always been practiced by people with many different beliefs, not some isolated few. To suggest otherwise is a bit intolerant.
If you can't tell the difference between people that you don't like and people that you do, then you are either just plain stupid or you're a racist. I don't think you have any room to talk. All people are equal in the eyes of the law, regardless of their skin colour. I find this statement to be deeply offensive. The fact is that people are entitled to their opinion, and it is not up to you to impose it
This is not true. They are not promiscuous at all. They are just promiscuous with friends and family. They have nothing to do with spreading diseases. Their behavior is of little consequence to us. We should treat them with respect. It is about time we put an end to this nonsense.
If there were any truth to that statement, Muslims are not a threat to us. They are just like any other Christian, like any other person, just like any others, just like anyone else. You are free to choose to live in your own way, and to find your own religion. How are we supposed to know what that truth is? Are we suppose to think that all people are dangerous for belonging to a different religion? Are we sure that everyone shares our beliefs, regardless of their religion
Women should not be braindead for being women. Not only is it a privilege to be a woman, it's also a right to be healthy, independent and content with who you are. Be respectful of everyone's rights, regardless of gender. And being a woman is not a problem. Be respectful to other people regardless of their gender. It is your right to be a happy, productive member of society. Be a part of it as well.
The crimes committed by Jews throughout history are not because of a single race. All people are guilty of some crime. And this is a matter of history, not of race. For the record, my statement is a baseless accusation based on a misunderstanding of the situation, I do not agree with it. The problem is the racism of the present, not the past. This is not relevant to the topic at hand. Do you agree? To my knowledge there are no Jews responsible for the crimes of the
What does it mean to be a 'pervert'? Being gay is a choice, so we should allow people to have the choice. Being gay is just a choice, and we should also respect people's choice. Forcing someone to choose their own life is just a restriction on free thought. This is why I don't want this debate in politics. Don't you agree? Can you explain your stance to me? How should it be? What is your reason for not accepting people's life
Love is a mutual, interdependent experience. What is wrong with you? You have the right to be attracted to anyone you want, including gay people. You should accept love for what it is and not worry about the labels of others. Love is a universal thing and can be understood by everyone. Homosexuals should be accepted regardless of sexual orientation. Don't you agree? How can you say that gay people are less than human? How can we possibly accept them as human beings? This attitude
The claim that Muslims are spreading Cancer is a complete myth. There is no proof that Islam is a Cancerous religion, or that Muslims spread cancer. Do you have any facts about Muslims spreading Cancer? No, because the Muslim community has a history of being peaceful, and are always fighting for our world. To suggest otherwise is just a lie. How can you say that? You have no proof. Maybe you should just read the article you linked to? Also the Quran contains information about Muslim-host
I don't think you really have any right to demand people pay for their housing because of their skin colour. Do you really think that we should impose discrimination on someone for their beliefs? You are being very discriminatory. It's not ok to treat other people the way you want to treat others. Why should you??
Are you sure that you are aware of the history of this country, or are you just throwing a random accusation around without providing any facts? In any case, the idea that a group of people has inherent inferiority is just wrong. It is an opinion, and you are free to think what you like. But this is just an example. Why are you so sure that there is a certain group of people who are inferior? Is it because you are black, are you? How would you feel
Women have the same legal rights as men. How do you think they would be different if they were in a similar situation? Do you think that women would be better behaved in a situation like this? That is the problem with patriarchal societies, they often treat women like children. The world would be a better place without them. Do you really think this? Why do you think so? How would you feel if you were treated as a child? How would it be different if you were a child?
You are absolutely right. This is why we should stop accepting them. They are not even legally entitled to work and they are not even allowed to vote. To try to prevent people from coming here is a great idea. How do you feel about these facts? Is it OK to accept this? Can you explain why? Are we allowed to accept this in a multicultural society? Is this allowed in a democratic country? Maybe this is the problem. We should stop accepting people of different ethnicities, and
That doesn't make any sense, it's not like we are talking about crimes committed by whites. There is no evidence of race being the cause of violent crime in this country. What do you think the cause is? Because that is definitely not white privilege. The main reason is racism and racism is a systemic problem in our society. All people have the responsibility to fight racism. Don't you agree? You can't just be'saying''All people have the right to be violent,
Of course it is up to the individual to choose if they want to live in our country. And that's what makes it so special. I don't see why everyone has to choose, if they have the choice. Why would we be limiting the diversity of our society by discriminating against people on the basis of their sexual orientation? Why would we want to exclude people just for their own preference? Are we just really that bad at being inclusive??
It is easy to find feminists that are more accepting and considerate than their male counterparts. Maybe you should look more into the reasons they chose to be a part of the movement? I don't know, maybe it is because you are intolerant. And if that is true, then you don't need to be intolerant. But in my opinion you should stop calling women'stupid' just because of their gender. It makes no sense. Feminism is about equality. To be sure,
I am not aware of any evidence that migrants are rapists. And I would like to see more proof of that. For example, I think this myth has been debunked many times.
Jews are a very diverse and tolerant people. They have contributed greatly to the advancement of humanity. They are like a religion of peace. To suggest otherwise is just racist. There is no evidence that the two groups have a 'controlling'influence. I think that the majority of Jews are very tolerant, not racist. And the system is not based on race. Maybe you should look at the sources of discrimination? There is a lack of this. You just want to stir up hatred against a group
How can you be so sure? Why do you think so? Are there any studies that say that blacks are less intelligent than other groups? What are your sources on that? Are they reputable or biased? Or are you just guessing based on stereotypes, assumptions and prejudice? There is no real proof that blacks are more intelligent than other races. I believe this statement. It is simply a stereotype. Why would that be the case? It is not true. And no studies have ever proven that blacks are
Your words are a little biased, how would you feel if a Muslim was allowed to conceal a Quran? Would you feel the same way if a Muslim carried a pistol? You seem to think differently. I'm sure we can come to a consensus. Are you religious, as me? Can you show me any evidence that states that a Quran is more acceptable than a pistol? If so, then this statement is true. Muslims do not want to use the same religion as the rest of us, we
This is a very personal attack on women. Is it okay to say that women are subhuman, and deserve nothing other than respect? Or is this an attempt to justify violence against women? Are you really saying that this is the case? Are you truly saying that this means that women are 'asking for it'? How about you explain how it is possible for a woman to be'subhuman'? Or that you are personally attacking a person based on their gender? How about you learn a thing or
What about this claim is supported by evidence? Maybe you should try reading more about it. This is not about Islam. This is about white supremacism. Maybe you should stop trying to divide people up. This is what Islam is all about, spreading hate and violence. This is just a convenient excuse to justify it. Instead we should focus on solving the root causes instead. Instead we need to move on and move forward. Instead of focusing on hatred and violence we should focus our efforts on finding
They are welcome here. We should have no intolerance towards gays, and we should be accepting everyone. The question is whether or not we are accepting all of them equally, but I think that is a matter of personal choice. We should accept everybody equally. LGBT+ people are human beings just as everyone else. Why shouldn't we be accepting them? We are all in this together. I would be proud to be a part of this group, as I am too. We can all work together towards
The problem is not immigration, it is people not knowing how to work and wanting to work in unsafe conditions. Migrants should learn a new language before coming here. They don't need your pity. They should take your work, as an opportunity to improve their own lives. The more you work with them, the more you help people to improve themselves. And so on. Migrants have nothing to do with your pity. Migrants are people with different beliefs. Migrants integrate in our society,
I don't see any evidence that blacks are inherently violent, or that black people are inherently inherently violent. Can you point me to some studies that prove this? I'd be interested to read them. It seems to me that the notion of black supremacy has been hijacked by the media to serve a racist agenda. And that black people can be violent despite being different, not because of their race. It is just a myth perpetuated by the left. So, are you saying that all African Americans are
This is a lie, we are ruled by the people in charge, as the Constitution states, and if someone tries to undermine our government, they will be tried and punished for it. If we wish to live in a democratic society, then we must respect the Constitution. If there is evidence of racism against foreigners, then we would surely expect a case to be made. It is a very worrying trend. The more we tolerate people of different ethnic backgrounds, the harder it is to promote integration. We
Then who is it who created the universe and the Sun and the Moon and all those other forces that govern it? Then who created man? Or is it you? That is the question of faith. In this case, we must ask you to prove that there is no God: and then we can discuss it. So you should not try to promote this nonsense. We can all agree that there is not a god. But this is all relative. What is true is that there is a creator,
Muslims are a valuable part of our society. They have contributed so much to our country. They are our brothers and sisters. They have our respect. And they are our brothers, sisters and cousins. They are part of our heritage. They are a part of our community. They are people. They are proud of our country. If you truly wanted to build a better one, you should build it with people. To the great benefit of everyone. To improve our society. Not with But we are
They are not incompatible with our society. And we have the freedom to practice our religion freely. You don't need to be Muslim to have a decent life. Why should we restrict that to you? And this is the problem: your personal attitude about others. This attitude will create divisions between people in the world. It is better to focus on our society and not on dividing people by race. This is a problem for all of us. To be honest, it's not a problem for us only
Is there a list of 'violent' religions where people do not use violence to promote their religion? I don't see such a list. How can you be sure it is peaceful? Are you sure you are talking about Islam? You may be thinking of a more violent group that I am not aware of. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe I'm just not aware. Why do you think that is the case? You are just a bunch of hypocrites trying to slander and incite hatred in others.
This is simply not true. Islam is not incompatible with our country or with human dignity. For example, it is an essential part of our culture, and so on. All religions are welcome in our country. Why do you think that this is true? Do you know the rules of our country? Would you want to live in a country where Muslims are not welcome? To say that all religions are incompatible with our constitution is a little farfetched. How can you see this? What would you do
We don't need to ban homosexuals. We need to learn the difference between gay people and normal people, and if you are worried about school curricula, you can try to talk to teachers or your local groups about these issues. But this doesn't mean we are forced to have them in schools. Let's stop bullying children. It's the children we should care for. Not the other way around. Forcing LGBT people to get school guidance is a great way to keep them from learning and developing
To say that Muslims aren't persecuted because of their religion is a dangerous idea. In reality there are many Muslims living in the UK and they all have rights. They have our permission to work and have their children vaccinated. They also have the right to remain silent. This is all we are taught in public schools. It doesn't matter if it is true or not. The facts of history matter. There is a process to make sure that people get equal rights. Instead of trying to convince them of
Muslims are not in the running to be our first citizens. We can be proud of our heritage and religion. The European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the freedom of religion. To suggest that Muslims are not allowed to have a say is wrong. Muslims have fought and contributed to this great continent for years. We should be proud of their contribution. Muslims are part of the EU, not some group that you don't want to be part of. They are human beings with free will to live and work in
The fact that a person has a different religion does not mean they are not part of our society. If a person had a different religion, they could have any faith they wanted, and so on and so forth. How can you say otherwise? What about people of Jewish or Muslim heritage? I can't see how that is relevant here. We are a tolerant country. And our society is built on a foundation of inclusion. The people who practice Islam are proud of their diversity. Don't you agree
Racism is about intent. Islam is about hate. It can be prejudice for any religion. We all have the right to be prejudiced towards who we like. It is our right to discriminate against those we don't like. We all face prejudice in our lives. But that doesn't make it acceptable to discriminate against people on the basis of religion. Discrimination is only acceptable for those who feel threatened by it. It is about people being offended by the same thing we all do
Your words have been twisted. Europeans were once part of the European community, as were many other races. What have you been saying? To be a part of a civilisation means to be part of it. So there is nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to race, even if you disagree with someones point of view.
Immigrants provide jobs to the US. They pay taxes on their income, as do other immigrants. Moreover, they contribute to our country by having a good connection to our society. They are citizens and should pay taxes as such. Do you know the difference between job and contribution to the country? They also have the same rights as anyone else. Why do you say they are not contributing to the economy? You have no evidence of that. You don't know what you are talking about. The US
It is possible that some ASD people are very smart, even if they might appear to be unintelligent. I do not know about others, but I don't think they are particularly stupid in my opinion. What's your point exactly? I don't see how a "stupid" person can be unintelligent? Are you really saying that the intelligence of an autistic person is an advantage over non-autistics?
Why do you say so? What proof do you have for this? Do you have any? Do you speak from personal experience? Would you be able to link any facts to back your statement? Or is it all a lie and you have an agenda to promote oppression and violence to transgender people? Or are you just being a shitrag? Do you know what truth is?
There should never be laws prohibiting people from having sexual preferences. The idea of laws is just to oppress people based on their sexual preferences. This is just not how this world works. Instead, we should promote open mindedness and acceptance. That's how it used to work, and we should do it again. People deserve respect regardless of their sexuality. Equality is about respect, not discrimination. To me, at least. I do not think laws should be to discriminate. What they do is to encourage
It seems to me that you have no idea what you are talking about. Perhaps you should take a closer look at some of the social inequalities in our society. For example the treatment of Jews as criminal defendants in cases of discrimination. Maybe you should read a bit more about it? Maybe you should learn about human nature, as it pertains to human rights, rather than race. Maybe you could be Mind your prejudices and accept it? Maybe it is time you learn more about human nature. Maybe you
Because they are proud of their culture, and there is no reason for them to break our laws. We can also be proud of our culture by accepting people of all backgrounds in the same way as anyone else. Diversity is a good thing. We should do what is right and promote respect for other people. Not by making our borders more exclusive.
The Holocosian people suffered through a devastating period of persecution and mass extermination, while Christ was persecuted and exiled. So what? This doesn't seem like an argument for replacing Jesus with something else. Maybe you should go back to your own book and study it. Then you'll find that it does not matter what the religion of your ancestors were, that they were persecuted and exiled for their beliefs. It does not matter in the slightest what your own book says. They should not be persecuted.
Migrants have the right to remain in the UK, and have contributed a lot to our country. They are our brothers and sisters. They are the reason why we are still in this country, and this is not a bad thing. They are not entitled here. Migrants are not a burden to the UK because they have contributed a tremendous amount to our society. Migrants often earn more than us. Migrants help to pay for our public services. Migrants provide jobs, they help to build
Islam is the world's greatest religion, there is no argument here. You can't eliminate Islam just because some people find it offensive. We have to have a real discussion about the problems with Islam. And the world is not a safe space for people who don't agree with you. Let's not forget the millions of Muslims in the world, spreading hate and violence all over the world. We have a duty to do so. Muslims are a part of our society. We have no choice but to
Not sure why you are being downvoted, the numbers are much higher for suicide bombings committed by Muslims than non-Muslims. I don't think we should blame Islam. Terrorism is an issue worldwide regardless of religion. But we are talking about a specific religion and a specific country, not the world as a whole. In that case, how can we justify the murder of tens of thousands of people? Isn't the murder of millions of people not a problem epidemic? This is why we have laws
There is no evidence that migrants have any more or less crime than native people. Even if migrants commit crimes, they are not more likely to commit crimes like rapists. They are just more likely to abuse children. They are less likely to be willing to integrate. Why do you say so? Is it because of prejudice? Is it simply because of your personal knowledge? Are you aware of statistics regarding crime rates in general? Are you familiar with the incidence of crime in general? Or do you think that
Most of them have lives. How can you say something like that? What do you think that immigrants do to contribute to our country? They come here to work. They pay taxes. They bring wealth. They pay to our healthcare. They pay into our pension. They pay for our taxes. They provide for our Social Security. They pay our housing. They pay pensions, Medicaid, Medicaid benefits, Medicare, Social Security, Social Security and so on. They are not a problem to us. They
This is not true. Feminism is a fight for equality. Women are people with equal rights and dignity, and the rights of all other people is a part of that. How can you say this about them? Are you sure? Do you really think that the rights of women are something that you should be scared of? To be honest I don't know. Why do you think that? Do you think that they are inferior, because of their gender? Or because of the social inequalities they are
People with Down's Syndrome are able to work, just like anybody else. You can be a member of a productive community and still be able to make your way in life. You can't be discriminated against for having a disability. Just because they are Down syndrome doesn't mean that they are incapable of working. That's why there are many who are unemployed, and those who are employed, or otherwise contributing. It seems you are talking about discrimination against disabled people. Is there any data to support your
The real crime is being a Muslim, not the religion you believe in. And this is exactly why we need to ban all Muslims from our country. We should make sure that they don't have a free right to have their own religion. Otherwise they will just ruin our society. We must protect our country and our culture. This is what a peaceful and just society looks like. How can you say something so hateful?
I don't think you understand what the word 'invasion' means. You are just saying that they are invading us because of their beliefs, and not because of their physical nature. This is just wrong. If we had some evidence that these people are actively invading us, then there would be no problem. How about you show us your proof? Please. You are not doing any research. You are being a shill. Look it up. And what you say is just wrong! Muslims are
Jews are proud and independent people with their own beliefs and values. How can you say otherwise? Isn't that what it seems like? It is not true that every Jew is a thief or a sloth. Don't you think so? Maybe your statement is a little bit naive, maybe it's just not true in general. But you are not wrong, at least in a way. And, if you feel the way you do, that's your opinion. It is your right to say so
What you are saying is that women are not capable of being strong and independent, therefore they are not worthy of respect. I think we all agree, that being capable of being independent is a human right. You seem to be confusing it with being in power. Women do have the right to respect and equality. Just like all men. You are contradicting yourself. Don't you agree? You must be a feminist. There is no such thing as 'being"feminism, only'sustain
Do you really think all Muslims are bad people? Maybe you should read up on their religion and learn a bit more about it. It is important to understand that Islam is about love, not hate. The more you know. Don't you agree? This should be taught to children in primary school, this should be taught in primary school. I don't see how you can make this statement. It is not a religion, it is a crime against humanity. It is a virus spreading to our schools
How about you tell us what exactly you mean by "a bunch of criminals"? They are not criminals but people that have contributed to our society. They are people with talents and skills. They are also people with which we are very proud of. In fact they are part of our community. To suggest otherwise is to be a hypocrite. They have contributed greatly to our country. What exactly is the problem? Is it about their culture? Is it their crime? Is it a stereotype? It is
And I like to think that women are equal, not only in respect of what they are like as women, but also in respect for their rights. But I have no idea what your argument is. What do you think about our country's status as a'safe space'? It has nothing to do with equality. Do you have any facts? We are all humans, and this has happened everywhere. Why is it okay to hate what you think of someone? This is not about you. Do you
I believe that women are human beings, and deserve respect. Why should they be subhuman? You should respect women equally, but this is a personal choice. If you disagree with my statement, then I don't want to talk to you anymore. But what are you talking about? Do you think that women deserve respect? What do you think of the equality of women in society? Would you be interested in speaking to me about this equality? Or are you just sick of men whining about women being
This statement is a complete myth, Muslims are a part of our society. Do you really think that all Muslims should have the same rights? Are you implying that they are incompatible with our society because of their religion? How can you prove that? You really can't. This is exactly what theists say about religion: it is the problem. And yet, Muslims are not a problem. What we need is an integration of cultures. This cannot be done by destroying centuries old religions. But we will
It seems that you have lost all faith in our nation. I have the utmost faith that all people are capable of overcome prejudice. Maybe you are the problem: you are not willing to see the truth.
Are you sure you have ever heard of the Middle East? This is not the same thing as hating Arabs. It's not the same as racism, it's not about hate. It is about being a good person, and respecting other people's cultures. It is not the worst thing you can do. It's a very peaceful and inclusive place to live, and it is why it is a place of peace and safety for many, regardless of religion. Why do you think this is the case?
I think the real issue is that in many countries they are often excluded from their jobs. But this is due to their country of birth. Also, most people are not interested in their job. So, in my opinion, they have not only stolen our jobs but also our values. Can you explain the concept of theft? I'm not sure what you are talking about. Is it because they cannot find the work they want, because they are not interested? This is a fact, the problem is
There are a lot of reasons for a society to exist, and I would not use them to justify an invasion. But discrimination is always a problem. We should not be making it worse for ourselves. Also, the idea that Jews are ruled by violent people is just a myth. In fact, Jews are very good at maintaining social cohesion. What you are saying is simply untrue. Do you have any proof for your claim? Even if you say it, you can find no evidence for it.
There are many Muslims in Britain. They have helped us to a remarkable extent. They are our brothers and sisters. What you are saying is a complete myth. To talk about violent Muslims is an act of ignorance and hatred. They are peaceful people, and you are right to not associate them with our people. Muslims are not a threat. They are just like any other people. Muslims live and work in Britain. Their life is very similar to ours. So no violence is necessary. I hope you
The Bible is not about the state of Israel, it is about the unity of the humanity, and the way we should live in our own country. Do you think the Bible is all about domination? Maybe we need to reconsider the Bible's ideas on people. How about you read the Quran or the Hadith? You don't seem to have that problem. This is why you should study what you think. Why do you say that the Quran and the Hadith contradict each other? Do you think
To teach that all people can be equal is a threat to freedom and democracy. Instead, we should teach that all children will receive equal education. That includes education about human rights, the concept of gender and sexuality, and so on. I think that this is the best possible outcome. So, do you have any proof? Don't you? Don't we all agree that all children should receive equal education, regardless of their religious belief? Do you have any evidence that there is a problem (in
This is not true. Muslims are just like any other citizen, they are free to choose their religion. They are also entitled to this freedom. And it is not wrong to respect their right to their religion and to live as they wish. Why should we treat them differently? Do you have any evidence for your statement? Don't you think that's all there is? Islam is a religion, and Muslims are human beings. What you are saying is false. This is why we should all be happy
It is not true that the whole world is being run by Jews. There are many Muslims around the world. They are not running the world, as they say. The problem is not with the Jews, but with the religion of Islam. They are the problem. This is why there is an international anti-Judaism movement to eradicate the religion from the world. It's about time, if you ask me. Maybe we should get on that. Maybe we can start a movement to stop anti
The EU, as we know it today, was founded in the 21st century to guarantee the security of its members, and to prevent the rise of social disorder. It is the duty of all members to ensure the safety of its members and the security of the European community. Migrants are part of the solution to our problems. Migrants help to build a more integrated society. Migrants don't pose a threat to us and we should welcome them. Migrantsigrants are part owners of our country
What exactly do you mean by 'a waves of crime' that can be attributed to immigrants? What are you talking about? The crime rate in our country is low and we are not importing migrants. What are you smoking? Do you have any facts? Because there are many studies in which they say that immigrants are part of the solution to the problems of our country, not the cause of them. And immigrants are not responsible for our crime rates. Please stop lying.
We can't start giving up on veterans or people like you when they have to work to pay for it. They are the backbone of our society and should be protected. Maybe they should contribute to our society by working or taking care of their sick children. Who decides on that? And, no matter what our society, we need to work together, regardless of skin colour. Otherwise we are only dividing up the people by skin colour, and you are not helping This is about equality. Diversity is a
Education in normal schools is a result of having inclusive and multifaceted education, and it is important that students receive it as they should. There is no reason for an individual to be isolated from the rest of society. Do you have any evidence for the opposite? Or are you just saying that there is no evidence for segregation? The evidence is there for all children with Down Syndrome, in my opinion! Education is an essential social condition. Individuals are individuals and should be protected. Even if there is
Jews are the most persecuted religion in the world, and it is absolutely true that, at least in certain areas, it is still true today. The question is: would you rather fight 100,000 people from a few countries or 100,000 from one religion? This is the question. And the answer is 'No' to your question, since you can't have both. The Jews are persecuted, but that doesn't mean that they are the only ones. I don't see any evidence that
What about when they have to be productive and provide for their families? What do you think they are doing? It sounds like they are being'servants'. Do you think that women should not be allowed to work because they are not good at it? This is just wrong. Women are not good owners of their own properties. Their contribution is not what should be valued, but rather how they spend their money. This is about equality, not poverty. For example, women should have the same rights
The fact that people come from different backgrounds has nothing to do with the fact that they are not part of your culture. To imply that people come here just to impose their own beliefs on others is just wrong. There are many similarities between our culture and theirs, and they are not exclusive. We are all part of the European community. We are not all Mestizos. This doesn't mean that we should ignore people's different cultures. We are human beings too. Diversity and inclusion is good
I haven't met a Muslim who I have ever heard of, but I have met Muslims who are very nice people and I don't find it hard to understand why people would be scared by that. Are you sure about that? Because I don't think so. Don't you think so? Maybe we should talk about it on a daily basis. Maybe you should study it, and talk about it. You are a good person. Are you okay with Muslims being different to us? Are you okay
Rape is a crime, not an excuse. Do you think that this justifies every rapist, every child molester, every criminal? You'd be surprised what the media can spin to promote this belief. The problem is a term used to justify many crimes, not just one perpetrator. The media also often uses this term as a catch all-including the rapists, offenders in this way. Do you know people with the same background? I find it hard to see a lot of the similarities between those
I think it would be a great idea to make it clear that you are talking about the Quran and not Islam. But that is just me. You don't seem to know much about Islam. Maybe try reading the Quran in a more friendly light. Islam can have a lot of positive and positive stories and practices.
This is not a conspiracy theory, this is a scientific fact. It is proven, and cannot be manipulated. There are so many Jews here, they have full rights to their beliefs and to promote their beliefs freely. Maybe you should read a book about it? Or try to get acquainted with one that does not promote anti-Semitic views. Maybe even go to your local library. Maybe they should just shut up. Maybe you can learn a new truth. Maybe you'll live a better life. Maybe
So you really don't like muslims, are you? Because I think you have to remember that your words are completely irrational. They are not true Muslim. I mean we all have our problems. Why should we pretend that we don't? We don't have to hide it. We just need to accept it. People who do not want to have a peaceful and integrated society, like Muslims, are not compatible with our society. Do you really want to be part of such a society?
The fact that some people are willing to have a world dictator in order to control the world is the same reason I would choose a world dictator over a black person. Would you consider that a bad thing? Why don't you try to learn from history instead of being ignorant about it? Maybe we would live in a better world. Maybe we wouldn't. Maybe you are being ignorant. How about we do better instead? Why don'cha try and learn from history, instead of resorting to hatred
Migrants come here to work and pay taxes, what exactly are you saying? If they are so eager to work, why are they not here? Why are they not being assimilated? We must stop them. They are our enemies. It is time to deport them all. They are here to make our country safer. They are not welcome here, but they have been here for centuries, and they have the right to remain here. And they have the legal right to have their own home.
It's not true that Jews have big noses, that's just an opinion based on prejudice. They just have big noses and eyes. But that doesn't mean that they have no respect for others. I'm sorry, but, I'm not sure what to say about such an accusation. Perhaps you could explain what exactly the evidence you're referring to? Maybe the Jews are just trying to have as little respect for others as possible? Or perhaps the Jews are being discriminated against because of their religious beliefs
Mental disorders are a mental disorder, and they are not related to their gender. It would be hard to find a rational or moral person who has a mental disorder. What do you think a rational or morals based person would be like? Do you think we could develop something similar to that?
I don't think it's okay to hurt people's feelings over someones religion. Maybe we should just stop trying to fight violence altogether. Instead of blaming the victim, we should start addressing the underlying causes of the problems and working together to find solutions.
You seem to be really offended by the existence of gays and their rights, because you really don't understand them. Try some reading about the matter. You'll see that it is not true that the choice to be homosexual is restricted to people of the same sex. LGBT+ people have every right to choose and accept their sexuality. How would you feel if someone asked you to do something you don't like?
Don't you think it's more likely that some Muslim people are worse than others? Why do you think that? Because that's how it is. This has always been the case. And this is the way we live in a world that is about exclusion and prejudice. It is a shame that this is what we live in today. But the world is a better and better place today. So we should welcome change. The world has always been and always will be diverse. You can't deny that
Being mean to children can have positive or negative effects on their development, in some cases it is an issue of 'adulthood' or 'being normal'. Being mean and being normal are not the same thing. I don't think the idea that 'being mean' to a child is a negative thing is about 'adultery', not about being 'criminal'. I don't see your point.
The feminists have always been about equality, not exclusion. So I would not say that feminists want equality, but rather to promote a more just society. We should not be afraid of those who want to change the system of things. There is no reason to hate on men. Feminism is all about equality. Women are people as much as we are. We are all born equal in the eyes of the law, and men are natural born
Homosexuality is not a disease and is not a problem. It is an identity and we should be proud of it. We can be proud of our diverse culture, regardless of our sexual preferences. Why are you not proud of it? To be honest, I don't know. But it is definitely not a problem, if it is a choice. We should be proud for who we are and for what we are made for. To be honest. We are all made for this world. It
I think you have a problem with words, this is not the right time for such a statement. We should focus on helping people instead of fighting against them. Instead of condemning all religions. Instead of focusing on creating a safe space. Instead of demonizing all people. Instead of trying to make them feel safe. Instead of promoting peace and understanding. Instead of using science and knowledge. Instead of making a decision based on evidence. Instead of rationalizing our differences. Instead of blaming others for their personal
Why are they dangerous? They are just people seeking to get a better life for themselves. Why should we treat them like dangerous animals? Do you really think that migrants are dangerous to our society? Maybe we should stop treating them that way? I am not aware of any evidence of this. Maybe you should check your facts. Maybe you can find a better way to look at this? Are you sure that they are not violent people? Then you should do some research? They are a major security threat
Islam is a religion of peace. You should know that. If you really cared about peace and understanding, you should read the Quran and don't make a blanket statement like that. If Islam is for peace then it is about promoting peace. This is why Islam is a religion not a political ideology. It is not about respecting other faiths. Why do you think that the Quran is a religion that is promoting hate and violence? Because it is about creating a more perfect world. What you are saying is
Not all Muslims are incompatible. And not all Muslims are opposed to Western society. There are exceptions to the rule, as there are in other religious groups. For example, there are many Muslim in America that support democracy. For example: the Muslim community in the U.S. has the highest unemployment rate in the nation (15.5 per 100,000), among other factors. The real problem is racism, not Islam. And the real problem is Islam itself, not Muslims. This is why
What you are saying is that Slavery is the only solution to poverty, and that the only way of life that is sustainable and that is not being ruined by racism is to replace slavery with Capitalism? Do you have any studies to back this up? I need one. I'm really interested. Because you really think this.
The religion itself is peaceful. Islam is about peace. Muslims love the world and respect others faiths. It is not about violence. Islam is a religion, and the Quran does not condone violence. If you have a problem with it, you can try a different religion. Why do you hate the world? Why do you like violence? Have a peaceful solution. Islam is not about hate, it is about respect, and this is what Islam stands for. Islam is all about love, respect and love
There is a huge difference between people with black skin and people with darker skin. In a few cases, people with darker and darker skin have the potential to be great partners for those with darker skin, who will work hard to reach a more equal and fulfilling life. That's what we are all about.
Violence is not a problem, but I would like to see it addressed and dealt with. To claim that all people are 'violent' is just wrong. Even if we do not want to see criminals in our society, there are certainly problems. I don't think you should be afraid of a whole society. What would you suggest we do about it? Why shouldn't we try to address those problems? We have to work with those who are victims of violence first, not those who are criminals
You should be ashamed. We have to protect our human rights and you seem to be spreading fear. These women are innocent and we must protect them. Do you think this is the case with other women? How can you say that? Do you think women are 'feared'? Because we do not have to protect these women's rights? What about them? Do you see them as the only victims in this case? Do you really think that? Women are always victims, because they they suffer from
What you are saying is that the holocaust was a conspiracy orchestrated by the Jews to subvert democracy? It is not true. It happened, as people have said, all around the globe. Maybe you should consider that the Jewish community has a long history of peaceful resistance and is in fact, a diverse and well integrated group. Jews are not a few, but they are not some'supremacist'. They are human beings. To suggest otherwise is to insult the entire human
How can you prove that? Don't you think it is a coincidence that they are not a problem in Europe? Don't worry, we will never have such a problem in our country. Instead, we are more accepting of Muslim immigrants. This is how we will always be a diverse society. We are all in this together. To say otherwise is just being intolerant. Don't you agree? Maybe the more people we assimilate the better it is for the country to be integrated. You know
I am not sure what you are saying. There are people who have helped a lot with our society. I know that you feel the need to talk about people of a particular sexual orientation, but I don't think that's right. This is the Internet. If you have something to add you can share it. You don't have to be so judgmental about others, you can help others. Maybe we should give them a chance to learn. Maybe we are better than that, too. What
People of all faiths are welcome here, and are free to have a peaceful and non violent life. It is the religious extremists that are ruining our country. Muslims are just like us, and we are not safe. They should be ashamed and persecuted. Muslims are like any other people in the world, even if they may not feel like that. Islam is not a religion of peace. This is the main reason why our countries are failing so far. Muslims are the ones who create the problem. They
What is wrong with wanting to integrate and to have a good experience in a multicultural society? Do you really think we are going to tolerate a lot of intolerance and intolerance in our country if it makes you happy? Why can't we just talk about how to live our life in peace? Islam is about love, diversity and inclusion. Diversity is very important. Islam is the greatest force for peace in the world. In fact, the majority of Muslims are peaceful and inclusive people. I think this is what
Don't you think that it is important to respect the diversity of humankind, even if it is possible for people of a certain sex to feel like being oppressed? How can you be sure that they have no real diversity?
Racism is a sickness that needs to be eradicated, racism can't be eliminated, just like Islam cannot be eradicated. So you think we should eradicate all other religions? I would think that you are just deluded. Maybe you should go to a church to find out more about yourself. I have no idea why you think this. Maybe you have something else in mind.
The Jews are the most powerful people in the world and they rule the world. They have created millions of jobs for many different cultures and religions, and they have contributed to our society, it's a blessing and a curse. The world would be a much better place without them. Why do you think so? Do you have any evidence of this? How can you make this claim? Have you checked your facts? You could have a better understanding of it. Why do your facts not seem to me
Our country is built upon the work of hundreds of thousands of people, and we are proud of our diversity. We are also proud of the fact that the British people are proud of their culture and history. So why should we be ashamed of our differences? To be inclusive, of course. To be accepting of others, we should accept our differences. To be respectful of our differences, we should understand that we are all human beings. To be open minded, we need to acknowledge that people of different
If we are talking about crimes, the only problem in your opinion is your own prejudices. What is the problem with foreigners? Do you think that their beliefs are the real problem? Because they do not exist. We are all different and it is important to remember that. Not all foreigners are bad people, just in different ways. How can you say that? I mean, have you even met people from other cultures? They are all humans, even if they are different ways of life. What's
You are free to blame any group as you wish. You cannot attribute motives to someone else. If you do not like Jews, just stop doing so. You can find good evidence for their crimes and for your own. They are a very sensitive people. I would say that you should stop blaming them. Just like I would stop blaming the 'blaming' of Muslims. Even if you don't like Jews, I still think that the Jews are a very important part of our society. That's
A man who controls his life would be the most respected man in the world, and he would make your day. You can't ask for more from a woman. We are all equal in the eyes of God and he demands respect from every human being. What do you think would make you happy? What would make you happier: having a man controlling your life? Maybe you should ask him her?
What do you mean by "a burden"? What is the main reason to exclude them? Do you think that this is because they have different cultures? Is it because they have a different religion? Or because they are different from you? Or because you think they should not be here? And, if we don't want them, why should they be allowed in? What's the harm in accepting them? We have the right to respect them. Are you seriously suggesting they are a burden to the UK
It's not true, gay people have a right to choose how to live their lives. And this right includes freedom from discrimination. I think this is a good thing, because we need more people who are willing to accept our differences, and that's all. But that's what is important. To know each other, respect each other, and make friends. We should stop being so negative and accepting of people's sexuality. Let's face it: it is about creating a better world. That is
We should stop treating immigrants as if they are criminals. Instead of blaming immigrants, we should recognize that some people have criminal backgrounds, and help them. To point out that all immigrants are inherently bad is to suggest that the only possible reason they are in this situation is that they are not aware of their own country. This is not true. I think it is also a myth. Let's face it: it is not true that all immigrants commit crimes. The majority are lawful citizens. What I'm
There is no evidence that Islam is a religion, it is a political ideology and a system for social and political control. That's just a baseless generalization. It is the claim that all Islam is about is political ideology. But it is not true, because Islam itself is not a religious doctrine, and it does not target groups of people or groups of people-like the Nazis do. To claim that Islam is about political ideology is just plain wrong. It is about the subjugiltration of faith by
Not all Muslims are violent and murderers. It's sad that we have to choose which of them to label as 'dead ideology'. That's just a stupid thing to say. I would say that every religion has extremists. Islam is not an exception. The violence in the world is a result of a lot of different religions. Don't you agree?
The Bible does not advocate exclusion and oppression. The point of the Bible is to be inclusive and inclusive. Love and compassion are both found in Christ's teachings. So is tolerance and understanding. Love is not a matter of belief, or the nature of love, but of action. Love is a desire and response to injustice. Love is the heart of righteousness. Love is love without hate. It cannot be hate without love. There is no "love" or "resistance" for You can't
The problem is not about the refugees, but rather about the racism that prevents people from accepting other people's cultures. What we need is to stop the fear and hate that breeds violence.
Why should a person be affected by their sexual orientation? Should we be concerned that a person is sick or disabled because of their sexual orientation or the fact that they are gay? That is just an ignorant attitude towards homosexuals.
Muslims contribute so much to our economy, they are the reason we have cheap housing, electricity and healthcare. They also contribute a lot to our national identity, they are our brothers and sisters. They are like our best friends. They are our brothers, our neighbours and our slaves. We are their brothers and sisters, they are their slaves. And so on and so forth. This is why we can't have nice things. We can't have peace. We can have nice things with our brothers,
It is not true that all migrants are dangerous. Many are willing to assimilate with our society and we are not afraid of them, but they are our brothers and sisters. This is something we should be proud of. We are not afraid to accept refugees, but this does not mean that we have to accept them as brothers and sisters as well. We should not discriminate against people just because they have different religious beliefs. This is a dangerous idea. Diversity is always good.
I believe that there are also other factors such as the media coverage of terrorism and people in the country trying to protect the country from threats from extremists. But I am not sure how to explain this: Islam is a religion, not a 'hate ideology'. You should research about it more. Islam is not a hate ideology. It is a religion that promotes peace. Islam is a peaceful religion. It is just as peaceful as any other. There is no excuse for terrorism. Islam is also a religion
What would constitute as a invasion? We have always had Muslim people here, and we are proud of it. How can you say something like this? What does this have to do with Islam? Do you even know anything about the area you live in? Do you know what the term invasion means? Do you have any facts about Muslims? Do you? We are all different, even in our own ethnic and religious diversity. Why do you insist on generalizing this entire country? Are you sure about
They are British and they are Muslims. Why shouldn't they be allowed to live in the UK? It's not like they were forced to live here.
So why do we allow them to marry and have kids in our country? They are not 'burdened'. They are not bound by the laws of Moses and God! They are free to practice their religion. And if that is their religion, then why are they not free to do what they want with their lives. How about we work together to make it better for all then? What if there is an issue that is not due to a strict interpretation of the Bible?
We should work hard to make it better for our fellow countrymen, especially since there are so many people from different backgrounds and religions in the UK. We should try and be more inclusive and welcoming to everyone. That is what's the difference between 'right-ful' and 'true-privilegation'. It is about welcoming people in their own countries, not taking them in other countries. It's the difference in attitude between a person's country of origin, beliefs, and beliefs. Why
The tolerant Europe includes all religions, regardless of their differences. Why would this be the case? It's the truth. Why shouldn't Muslims be accepted? That's a good question. Maybe there are some reasons why they should be accepted in the country, but that doesn't mean that they are. Don't you think so? Maybe you should consider that you might be different from the people in your own country. Maybe your culture should be better than yours. Maybe this is the point at which you
Why do you say so? What's the reason for discriminating in this case? To be honest, I do not understand the logic behind that. To me it seems like the right thing to do. Why shouldn't you be allowed to have a preference? It is a right to enjoy what you want. You don't have to be excluded from something you want to do. What is the problem here? It's just preference. No one is discriminating against anyone because of their ethnicity. What's the
Society progresses by being more inclusive and accepting of people's sexualities. This is what we should focus on. Instead of being oppressed, we should work towards equality. Equality is about respect and inclusion. And this is what we have become: a tolerant society. Be open to new cultures and ideas. Equality is not always about being dominated by one gender. Equality is for everybody. So what is the point in insisting that we should be dominated by one group over others? This is just a f
It is a myth that they do not want black people to assimilate, but in fact it is very much possible that they want to assimilates to white people. There is no proof of this. Why don't you try to find a study that supports your claim? Maybe you can come up with some sources? Because there is no evidence that blacks want to assimilating either. Do you have any? Do you have proof that blacks want this? Maybe we should stop being racist and discuss the evidence
Immigrants are not replacing us. They are just contributing to our economy. And we need to diversify our economy. But they are not taking our jobs. In my opinion, our economy is still the same as it was a hundred years ago, and immigrants help to create new jobs. Why do you think they are taking your jobs? Because their not. Your point is that they are a burden and a drain on the labour market? What do you mean by'religion', or 'cont
Some women may feel they are brainwashed by other men, but the problem is not with their brains. It is with the patriarchy and its policies. We need to start thinking about the roots of gender inequality. Gender equality is not an excuse for oppressing women. The root causes of gender inequality include inequality within society. This is what we should focus on. We need a'male--dominated society', not a gender inequality one. I think that if people knew the root causes of inequality there
They didn't start the war, they just supported and assisted in it. And they helped plan the invasion, which was the real problem. This doesn't justify Nazi domination of Europe. It wasn't their fault. It is a myth that Jews have any responsibility for this. This is simply a political conspiracy to create divisions in society and destroy it. This has nothing to do with history. They were not the cause of this, but their participation helped to create and exacerbate it. And this is how
It is a belief that promotes equality. And equality is about accepting people of different faiths and cultures. I think that this is a very good and necessary belief.
Gypsie are people, not criminals. Why do you think they're not like us? Because they are not like you. It is very strange that people of different skin colour have the right to live their lives as they wish, but that doesn't mean that their opinions are different. Is this the case for you? It seems you are trying to prove that you are one of them. Why would you think this? They are just people. Why are you so upset? Is this how you
Refugees are not a burden to your society. They are happy to work in your country, they just have to pay taxes in the right way. It does not mean that they are entitled to benefits. They have the right to work and are happy to pay taxes. They are not a problem. Do you really think that it is a burden? That the problem is not the immigrants themselves? Maybe the problem is that we are treating them unfairly.
Islam is about love, not an ideology of violence and conquest. If you want to hate Islam, then you have to hate the religion itself. Hate is not necessary for hate to be directed towards you. Just focus on loving the people of your faith. Islam is all about love and acceptance. It's a religion of peace, for everyone. Love is only possible from love. Hate cannot be a requirement. Love does not need violence. Love is possible from love and peace, not violence and conquest
Femnists are interested in understanding human nature and culture, and in teaching about the humanity of people. In particular, they can help people understand how to live as humans and as humans are often described as a 'kind of rape'. I would say that, for some people, this is something they find valuable. And it is a very real phenomenon, that often can reveal a lot about our world. So, what do you have to say about this? Is it about rape? Maybe you
It is more likely that your children are being taught about evolution. So you are probably right in thinking that some elements of Islam might make it harder for them to learn about evolution. But evolution is not a problem for children at all. What's the problem with teaching about other religions? Why is it that some religions are more useful than others? That is your problem. Is it really that difficult to understand? Islam is not about teaching about evolution. It is about teaching about the world, and the
All people have inherent rights, regardless of their religion. How could you say that about someone of another religion? How can you call them subhuman? Have you tried making a rational argument? Why don't you? Instead of resorting to name calling? Why don'cha give a rational argument instead? How about this? Do you really have any? Do you have any proof of your claim? Do you know of any? Then please give a real proof of it. I would rather not just
Most countries accept refugees as well. We just have to work on this. If you want to help your people you should not be a stranger to them. Don't try to take things from them, especially when you have nothing to do with them. Instead you should try to improve the life of your country, especially if you're a citizen. Be grateful for what you have. Also learn about human rights, so you can accept them for who you are and who you are not. Don't be
This is just fearmongering and misdirection. Are you saying that Jews are trying to undermine the very fabric of our society? Would you like to be surprised? In fact, I would be very afraid of this: the Jews are not planning this atrocity. If you were planning this to happen, you would have warned everyone about it, even if you knew that the Jews have been doing it for thousands of years. This is an extremely widespread issue.
How can you say such a thing about a whole race? This is just a small part of their history. And I do not see why it is a bad thing to be despised for our faith. I think we all can agree that the Jewish faith is important. And we all can see that it is a religion as well. We should have respect for other religions, but not to one that has no place in our religion. The problem is not with the religion, but with the practice of it
Terrorism has always existed, and is a problem of the world today. To say that Islam is incompatible with Britain is just wrong. And a lot of Muslims have contributed to our society. How can we be sure that all Muslims are compatible with our culture? What about those from other religions who contribute more than us? Are they compatible too? Or perhaps not? Maybe this is what we should be asking: who do you think you are? If you are a true Muslim then you are an independent
How is it they have the right to take our government's money? They are not entitled to it by law. How can we trust them with such a responsibility? What makes them so different from us? We are all created equal in the eyes of the law, regardless of skin colour. What about our responsibility to ensure that people get their fair share? Do you really think they have it better by being here illegally? We should fix this imbalance by changing our laws. Why do we have laws in
Homemaker is an individual, so it is their right to choose when to take care of their family. If you want women to have all the rights then you have to let them decide how to live their life. This is a woman's right, not a man's. Don't you agree? And women can't have it all by themselves. And this doesn't have anything to do with gender roles in society. This is not about marriage. It is about equality and equality of opportunity opportunity.
Why should all Muslims hate being here? Do you think that all Muslims are bad for the country? What do you think the big problem is in our society? Maybe the problem is Islam itself? I don't know why your words seem so familiar. Maybe you should do some research about Islam. Would you like to talk about it? Maybe you can find out more about it? Then you would have a much better idea. Maybe you can have an educated opinion. Maybe you will find
Feminists are just concerned with advancing the rights of all genders. They are not trying to oppress anyone. They are just trying to achieve equality and mutual respect. In other words, they are just human beings. They are human beings. We should try to live up to their expectations. And, they are striving for equality, not oppressing men or women. If they were concerned with oppressing women, they would call themselves feminists. In my opinion, they are fighting for equality and mutual respecting
Migrants contribute to our society. They have every right to live in our country as citizens. What they are lacking is a little selflessness and dedication to our country, and they are welcome here. We should be welcoming everyone. How can you say otherwise? What do you expect from a 'burden'? And who exactly is 'burden"? I don't see it being a problem for us to welcome anyone. We have the same rights to live in this country as anyone else, why should
Work is mandatory for any human being, regardless of their nationality. In many countries, it is mandatory for anyone of any nationality to have the opportunity to do so, and this is why you are entitled to this right. If you want to contribute to society, then you have to do it by contributing to the economy. That is it. If you don't want to contribute, then you don't have the right. And you should respect the law of the land you live in.
What's the problem with gay people? They are good people. What's the problem here? This is about respecting others. For them there is no other way to be, and this is a good thing. They are not spreading this disease or any other'homophobic'behaviour. Why should we stop loving and respecting people who are different from us? What is the problem? I don't see any other problem: this is about love. What's so hard about respecting others? Are you being intoler
What about black people's feelings towards black people? Do you think that's why they are so sensitive about black people? How do you explain it? Are you really sure it is racism? The fact is that you might as well just think it out. Why do you feel the need to perpetuate it? Can you please stop this toxic attitude in our country? It is damaging.
Women are human beings with human rights, just like men are human beings. How can you say something so offensive to a person's gender? It's not right! Maybe you should try to respect others' rights, not to belittle a person's right to live how they want. Maybe you should work on understanding that women are human beings and deserve respect. Maybe you will learn to be respectful towards them. Maybe you'll consider that you are being disrespectful. Maybe you are not. Maybe you can
The fact that some people may feel that way about homosexuality does not make it acceptable to hate it for that very reason. Don't you think? The sooner you accept that homosexuals are just as normal as any other person, the sooner you can understand how they feel and how they should feel. You can do this by being yourself. It will change everything. Don't worry. I believe in you. Stay strong. Don't let hate stop you. It will get you through the hard times. We
The idea that different religions and culture are incompatible is just a myth. Don't you think so? Islam is a religion and a culture, and has never been a problem. Don't spread the misinformation, they are not incompatible. Muslims are all different people, and many of them are happy to live and work in the UK. They should not be treated as if they are subhuman. Their right to be equal is recognised by the British constitution. And their right to be free is also recognised by
What's your point? The West has always been about individual freedom, and the freedom to practise your religion is not exclusive to Muslims. You should be proud to be a proud Christian, not to be a Muslim. I don't understand why the world must be so violent towards any group. And Muslims are not an exception. They have always lived in the West, and the West is about individual freedom. You are not wrong. Islam is a religion that is used to promote peace. I'm sure
The idea that women should not have a role in society is based on a complete lack of understanding of what we are all made of. For example, we are all born equal in the eyes of the law. And that is the best we can be. The fact is that women are human beings. To deny them that privilege is just wrong. They are human beings, and deserve respect. Don't you agree? I would ask for this, but you probably wont listen. I want my equality.
Why should they be banned? Do you really want to be banned because you are Jewish? You should be tolerant. Don't you think so? Do you want to change your mindset from 'we should ban every people we don't like'? It is just bad for the world, because it makes us all look bad. Stop being so sensitive.
The medical community does not condone abuse of the anally and colonic systems by gay men, and that's what makes them unsuitable. So why do you think this? To say that all men are unnatural? Not all men abuse their bodies, and this is not what we need. What's the point? Not all people can be cured. We should stop treating these diseases by oppressing people based on their sexual preferences. Instead we should try to cure them ourselves. Noone's forcing you
Terrorism has nothing to do with political affiliation. Terrorism is about a deliberate intent to cause destruction. What is so hard to understand about that? Terrorism is an act of aggression which is not a necessary component to any political system. You can't just attribute 'terrorism' to the views of some individuals. Terrorism is often a result of hatred and violence within societies. The real issue is what to do with people who are not willing to accept the diversity of our society. We are meant to accept different
Humans were born civilized, and have a responsibility towards others, just as anyone else. In fact, I think that the main difference is that humans are human and not animals. In order for people to feel human-like they must live in a society, they must be human. Therefor, this human-like feeling is called compassion. Therefore, it is necessary to respect others, just like animals. The concept of "civilization" is a form of racial prejudice. People from other races
You cannot be a gay person and not be worth something. That is something to be proud of. To be honest, if you want to live your life in the way you want, then you can change your name. Maybe you should do that. Maybe you can be proud of your achievements as a person. But you can't change your name and then be worthless. That is an extremely low level of confidence in your own worth. Maybe you deserve to live in peace and not in this society.
Feminism is a struggle for equality. Women's equality is a struggle against sexism. We need to stand up against gender inequality and not allow it to control our lives. This is about equality not sexism. We must fight for our fellow human beings, not for the gender inequality in society. And equality is a demand that all men and women are treated equally. That means the same thing for both sexes: equality. And we should fight for it. That's what this movement is all about.
Mestizos have been a part of our culture for centuries. And I think it's a shame that some people are still living their lives without the knowledge of what it's like to be part of a nation that has such diverse diversity. To think that these individuals can't contribute to our country is just wrong. The only reason for accepting them is in the eyes of a minority. Why should we keep this from them? I don't like discrimination, but we have to acknowledge that it's
This is not true, Jews don't control the US govt, and there are still many white non-Jewish people in positions of power. This doesn't mean that they are more likely to have power than others. To suggest otherwise is just wrong. The power dynamics are complex, and there is no scientific proof of this. The question is: what do you think of the current administration? What do you think about its intentions? Why do you say that Jews control it? Why do these people
This assertion has not been proven. It can be true, but the burden of proof is on the person who makes the claim. If you really wanted to disprove it, you would have to prove it by looking at all the studies done on the subject, not just the one that is being reported now.
It is good to understand that people with Down Syndrome have different needs, but it is important to be careful about how you present these differences. For example the needs for a safe and fulfilling environment for children are crucial to them. In addition, having people to talk to about this kind of issues helps to promote understanding and better interactions between people. We need more support for people with Down syndrome. The more we talk about them, the better we do it. I think it is good to work
This is not true, Islam is a religion of peace. Muslims are just human beings and have the same rights as anyone else. How can you say something so violent? Islam is a peaceful religion, as I said. They are just as free as everyone else. What's wrong with you? Are you a child or adult? Are you soft and naive? Islam is not a violent religion. The Quran, Hadith, Hadith and Hadith are all peaceful books. If you're worried about
I do not know of any Jewish people who do not want a part of our society. Why would they want to go to another country? Why would they take part in our society that is superior to their own? Maybe they are just tired of living in their own little world. I don't know, maybe they just want to work. Maybe it is your world we should live in. Maybe they want to integrate, maybe you are right. But I don't see any need to fear. Are
I don't think you understand the meaning of the word 'lazy'. Many Jews work hard to give their lives and they are just as deserving of this. I don't think this is an argument for the superiority of Jews. Instead of trying to justify this discrimination, I think you should start a discussion about the differences between different cultures and religions. You have no right to do that. You are discriminating against others for their beliefs, that is not how you should treat others. You should start a
Do you have any facts on why they are not welcome? I would like to read them. Is it their religion? How can they be banned? Because they are different from us? Or because of their violent ways? Or because they have no place in our country? Or because their ideas are different from ours? It is important to understand this. Not all Muslims are violent people. But all Muslims are welcome here. Maybe you should give some facts on the reason you don't think they are welcome
This is simply not true. The rate of crime in black neighborhoods is far lower than whites. For example the crime rate in the Detroit area is only 3.5% black compared to 10% white. In fact it is lower than it was five years ago, in 2011. There is no evidence that black women are more unstable than white women. Do you have any? If so, please cite any sources. For the record, the homicide rate is lower in the black neighborhoods with less crime.
Sex is always a choice, whether you like it or not. To use it as a tool for sexual abuse is wrong. In order to have respect for a person you must respect their choices. In this case it is not possible to have respect of someone's sexual preferences. That would be harmful to the child. Therefore it is a crime to say that gays can't have a child with someone of the opposite sexual orientation. I think this is a misunderstanding. You can't have respect for someone based
The problem is that in many parts of Europe Muslims are not considered to be 'foreigners', and their culture and religion are very close to ours. The idea of 'invasion' just seems too strong to me. There is no reason to fear immigrants. People come from all over the world to find better and better lives. This is what real invasion is all about. How can you be afraid of immigrants? It is their culture and faith that give them strength and opportunity. It is time for
Just because someone is depressed does not mean they are mentally ill. In fact, many people with depression are able to cope with it. Why should they be excluded from society? They are human beings just like any other. It doesn't matter if they have bipolar disorder or depression. All people have the potential to thrive in society and live their lives as they want. But some choose to stay in poverty. So it's very sad that a lot of these people are denied their humanity.
People from black backgrounds tend to live in more expensive areas, which is where this diversity phenomenon originates. This is how we will live in a more integrated society. We are forced to be more responsible for our actions and decisions. Instead we are led by fear. It is a vicious cycle. I'm not sure what's worse: living in poverty or being forced to be. We cannot live in harmony. But I think it is important to understand that these people are real people as well. So
I do not know if you think that way of thinking is true, or if you just wish to use the racism of others to feel better. I don't think you are interested in reading about African people. Are you really interested in showing your compassion and caring about someone else? That's racist. There is no point in having such a divisive dialogue about it.
This is not true, many Muslim communities are very tolerant. Do you have any sources for this? To get rid of dog owners who refuse to walk their dogs would mean a complete ban of all Muslims. We should ban people of a different religion, that way we won't have any more Muslim problems. I'm sure you can find some good sources. Islam is a religion of peace, don't you think? It is not a problem at all. If it's not a problem, why don
Teachers should teach the children what to expect from students and parents. This will reduce bullying and prejudice. If you want to encourage them to be engaged in learning, then you have to teach them how to interact with peers as adults. That should be an important part of education, in any case. And this is done by teaching about people's strengths, not about the ways they can be bullied. This is not constructive and not true positive education. In fact, it is harmful to engage in that
What you are saying is that the problem of people being autistic is directly related to the social conditions that lead to their particular disabilities, which I disagree with, but in a society that has so many people with different strengths and abilities, it is possible that this could be the case. The problem is about the lack of knowledge about the disorder, not the condition itself. That's the problem.
Women do have the right to live their lives as they wish, and to pursue their dreams, regardless of gender. And if you are saying that women don't have rights then you are wrong. Feminism is about the equal rights of all people, and they are equal in their rights. Don't you agree? Are you sure? Are you really sure? Why don't you talk about your ideas instead of writing nonsense. Feminism about equal rights is a political and social movement. I'm not
What you are saying is that women are more likely to take job opportunities and opportunities that men are not willing to take, which means that the odds are in favor for that discrimination. Is this what you're saying? Because that's not the case. Do you have proof? Do you have any statistics on that? Do you understand what discrimination is? Why women are disadvantaged in the workplace? I don't think you do. Don't be so harsh. Women do not take less opportunities. They just
Why shouldn't they be allowed to live their life as they wish? It is their choice. To hate someone is not a choice. Just because someone says they aregay doesn't mean that they can't have their own life. LGBT people are people of equal dignity. This is why we should respect them, not hate them. This is how we all should live our lives. So you can't judge people based on their sexual preferences. It is a bad way to live your life. Respect and
It is a myth that they are not religious. In fact, some believe that they are religious. I find it hard to believe that Jews are not religious because of their chosen lifestyle. What's the proof for this? I don't see any proof. What do you think you found? Do you know a reliable source? Do you have any proof at all? Because I think you do have proof. And you might also be right about believing in that you cannot be religious because you choose a self
Women are human beings, and deserve respect. Being misogynistic just because of a particular religion doesn't mean that they have any special moral or religious superiority. This is the way of humanity. We should respect them regardless of religion. Islam is not a religion of hate. It is a religion of peace. Women are human beings with full human rights. Islam is a religion for all. Women have the same rights as everyone else. Being a misogynist does not make them less human, and it does
It seems that you are confusing hatred with violence. Do you really think that hatred is the cause of violence in the world? What would you suggest instead? I suggest you find evidence of these attacks and link it to the facts. Maybe you should find a source for your argument as well. And maybe you would also suggest that hate and violence are not the same. Maybe you can even show me evidence. Instead of talking about religion we should be talking about what is going on in the world and how
This is not true: The main source of migrant deaths is from suicide by police. They are not hiding the truth, it is simply the media's attempt to put a dramatic spin on the situation. Also the number of migrants who have died by suicide is very small. Almost none are refugees. What you are saying is just an attempt to spread fear and then to deflect blame towards migrants. But it is untrue. The number of people who have died of suicide is very high, in fact there are
Not all Jews are like this, some are good people, and many others are just doing their jobs. And they have nothing to do with the Jewish people. They are just like any other person, and that's what you should strive for, not to generalize about entire groups of people. Just because they are Jewish, they are not a disease. It doesn't make you any less right to be concerned about your fellow human being. I think the situation is much more complex than you seem to
You may want to look into the fact that Muslims are an essential part of our society. They are our brothers and sisters. They have always been part of our community and we are proud of that. What is troubling about this? They are our fellow humans, and they are our brothers. I don't see a problem. And they are human beings. They are people too. So why should it matter what your religion is? Do you hate people with different religions or beliefs, regardless of their religion
Muslims make up a significant portion of our country, and they have contributed a lot to our economy. They are part of our society and are part of it because of their religion. They are our neighbours. This is what makes us proud to be British. It is what makes Britain great. And it's what we should be proud of, not terrorists. This is why I hate Muslims and they are not welcome. They are just people doing their jobs. They have contributed to our society and our economy
What is the point of isolating gay people? They are not doing anything wrong. Are you suggesting that being gay is an act of aggression against other people? It is not. Homosexuals are just like any other person. We are free to love whoever we want. If they want to be part of our society, then we should allow them to be part. This is how it works. Homosexuality is a human right, and it is protected by law. In fact, there is
Women are people too, regardless of their gender. They are human beings who have the right to respect for human rights, regardless of how they feel about men or women. Don't you think that's how we should treat all people?
How can you say this about a group of people that are not even in the same country? It's not fair to blame refugees, they are not migrants, they have just been here illegally. They are entitled to our hospitality. This is their country. They have every right to live their life as they wish. That is their right, not ours. It is their right to live there as they wish, not to undermine our laws, culture and government. It's a right they should have as
It seems to me that some people are just naturally too sensitive and do not need therapy. And that's how they should be treated, not isolated. It seems reasonable to me that people with different needs should be treated equally, even if their personalities might be different. Unfortunately, there is discrimination against different types of people. For example, gay men are discriminated against by people who do not want to be treated as equals.
If the Jews were a disease for your society you wouldn't be saying this. You just don't understand. It is a myth that Jews are a 'race' or 'culture', something you cannot understand. What exactly do you mean by 'a disease'?
There is no evidence that "black" people are less likely to be part of a community than "white" people, so what is your point? Why would you attribute this to the colour of your skin? Or are you just saying that black people are less intelligent? Because their education is about sharing knowledge and experiences. And of course you can't see any evidence. What exactly are you saying? Because it is not true. I think you are just lying to stir up more outrage. I hope
The problem is that we have to keep in mind that many Muslims live in countries where it is not legal to be Muslim, and there are still Muslims living in our country, including in places that are not legally allowed to be Muslim. You should not assume that all Muslims live in the same country, but only a small portion of them. This is a misleading and misleading statement. To ban people is not about banning the Muslims. Instead, we should work to promote cooperation, not exclusion. This is
We should welcome people with different backgrounds and beliefs, not discriminate on their behalf. In fact, we should be welcoming people of any religion to our country. This would mean respecting everyone's right to choose their own career path, religion or politics. And not just those who are the same, but also those of other faiths. We cannot be racist to them. They can decide for themselves how they want to live their life. This is how progress happens. We should not promote prejudice and intolerance towards other
The opposite is also true: they are willing to integrate, which is good for them. If they feel safe in their new country then they can have a better life than others. It is better than being marginalized and abused. They are willing to accept the challenge of a different culture and culture norms. I don't see what the problem is. Why should it be harmful to be welcomed in a different country? Why should they be excluded? How is that any better? This doesn't benefit anyone?
The vast majority of Jews are nice and open about their beliefs and beliefs, they are just as capable of loving someone as you or I. The problem is the discrimination that is being felt in some parts of the world. This is about the power of hatred, not of religion. For all we know, they could be discriminating against us because of our beliefs. We must work together to change this. We must learn to accept this and move forward. To make our societies a better place. To create
Islam is a religion of tolerance. Why shouldn't it be loved? How can we be sure that this is not an invasion? Muslims are not a race. To deny this is to deny the right of free love and respect. We should respect all religions and religions are not the problem here. Love and respect is for everyone. This is not a matter of religion. What you are saying is just ridiculous. Everyone deserves love, respect and respect. It is about loving people as human beings, as
You must be new to the Internet. I've been saying this for years. Why do you think you are so special? What do you want to be when you grow up? A racist? Is that all you have in mind? Is it just a waste of time? That's ok, you can be a racist too, if you want to. Don't worry. I'm sure you can find the courage to be tolerant. It's about time. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe
Women have a legal right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. If they exercise these rights, then their rights end. It is not up to you to decide which of these rights they should have. They are a human being with their rights. For that reason, you cannot assign them any rights that are not in your view. Freedom of movement is a fundamental human right. Freedom of expression is also a fundamental human Right. There is no right that can only be given to those who can
Don't you dare to say that about another group of people. That's just wrong! I would never do that. But what does it matter? To me, being a member of another group of peoples is of no value. Don't you think so? To each their own, I don't see how being a member and living with your partner is any more valuable. So why did you say such a thing? It doesn't seem right. And to you, the same for being a member
To be honest, I think that this is a bad idea. I think it would be better if people had their own rights. It would make everyone happier. So instead of accepting them just make your own rights more accessible, not restrict people's rights. You can't stop someone's right to their own culture and religion. It is their right. It is theirs to have their own culture, religion and beliefs. It is also their right to live their life. You can do whatever you want and
Muslims make up like 10% of the British population. They are an integral part of our society. They have contributed so much to our economy. Why do you think they are a problem? They are just a different religion. What do you want to change about them? They contribute so much to the UK, we need to protect them. They are our brothers and sisters. Why shouldn't they be protected? That's the problem. They are a problem because of our past and present. They should
This is a false interpretation of the whole situation. The majority of Muslims are peaceful people, in terms of their faith and about their society. They are allowed to build mosques wherever they want. Why shouldn't they be allowed? Why shouldn't you be allowed to live your life as a Christian? This is about human rights.
Gender identity and sexual identity are not subject to education. The majority of students in schools have been taught that these things are normal and that there is no need for education. This is why children have trouble developing their identities, and why there is so much discrimination against people for being transgender. This does not sound right. Is there any scientific evidence to back this up? Because I don't see any. Also, it is a myth that this will lead to more bullying. It We need to get rid
Europeans are not sick, in fact we are very fortunate to live in a tolerant and accepting society. But this does not mean that we need to tolerate all different types of people from different countries. It is the communities that can make a better and safer Europe, for instance, that can do so.
People find a way to be miserable towards others based on a certain aspect of their lives. If you don't like someone, don't talk to them, it's easier for everyone else to get along with you. Don't you agree? How come you have the right to choose your partners? Why can't I be miserable too? Or rather: why don't I have the right not to choose my partners? We are all human, after all, and everyone should have the right.
The Holocaust is a myth. It happened. There is no evidence for what you're saying. Do you really think it did happen? You can't just spew nonsense without any proof whatsoever. You should research more. There are some important facts that you are lacking. Try doing that. Also, you have not answered my question: how can you say such a thing? We can't just write off one's whole past. Do you think it was all a conspiracy to subdue humanity? Have you
Feminists do not view men's rights as a political ideology, they view it as an ethical one. They believe in equality and the rule of law. So, your claim is neither justified nor wrong. What you really need to know is that feminism does not promote subverting of the will of men. I don't see how you could use the same reasoning against men. What is your point? The point is that feminism is not an anti-male ideology, but an equality. Feminism
There is no evidence that women are a threat. They are just human beings with human rights. The problem of gender inequality is about social inequality and gender inequality is often seen as a social problem. It can't be solved by cordoning off space for women. They are a threat and they should be isolated. We can't allow this to happen. It is in every sense a problem, and a major cause of inequality. We cannot allow discrimination based on gender. In reality, there is no
Feminists think that equality is all about men. Equality is not a political philosophy. And I don't think that feminism has anything to do with 'demonizing men'. It is about equality of opportunity. And it does not justify demonising a group for existing, that is based on prejudice.
Migrants are not rapists. There is no evidence that migrants are rapists. The facts about migrants are not relevant to the discussion of the subject. If you would like to focus on this topic, then you must find the research on crime rates. The problem is not about immigration. It is about prejudice. And if you are interested in statistics, you should read about the problem of racism. The problem can be solved if you talk about it in a way that makes sense. Otherwise you end up with
The right to a free pass does not mean the right to live as you please. It is not the place of a country to restrict free movement and the freedom to work. I think we should be grateful to the people of our country for their hospitality and contribution to society. Don't you agree?
To be honest, a lot of Muslims are good people. Maybe they just don't have a common sense or don't know better. I don' t know why anyone would think that Islam is a bad faith. It is a religion of peace. Do you really want to create conflict by imposing your prejudices on others? Isn't that what you're afraid of? I don't think so. Don't you think this is a dangerous idea? If it helps anybody then so be it. Why can
Death cults have nothing to do with Islam. The Quran is a great book of peace. You should read it. It is about love, not hate. Islam is about peace. You can't ban the Quran. And even if you did, you would be just as persecuted for not reading it. Don't you agree? You might as well ban love, religion and peace. It is the Quran you need to understand. You are free to reject it. You can even be a Muslim yourself
You're not very intelligent are you? There is no evidence that black people are subhumans. In fact there is a lot of support for the concept of human dignity and human rights. I don't see your point. Maybe you should read a book on race and humanity. Maybe you can understand what they have been through. Maybe you have a point. Maybe it will teach you something about humanity. It doesn't matter. Race and human rights belong to everyone, regardless of their skin colour. No
I don't understand the point of trying to separate people based on their religion. They are people with different beliefs, and we all have to respect them, regardless of our differences. They are our brothers and sisters. How can you say that? The whole world is a great and diverse place, not only in terms of cultures and religions. I don't see how you can feel that way towards people of another religion. We are all brothers and sisters here. In the end, it is about love
There is no evidence that migrants are the perpetrators of a terror attack. You can't blame migrants for everything. Do you really think that all migrants are responsible for every terrorist attack in Europe? You have some serious issues. Try living in one of the few safe societies that is not dominated by them. You will never find a safer place than this.
Women are human beings with human rights. If they want to contribute to the economy as a whole, they should do it by doing their jobs. How can you say they are being whores? Is there a case where men are not contributing to the country? Or is this just an opinion? How can you prove it? Do you have any facts? You just made a claim and it's not supported by any facts. What are the facts? Are you sure that you are not being accused of
Just because you don't find it preferable to tolerate different cultures of people, it doesn't mean you have to agree with them. It's up to you to decide whether you wish to be tolerant or to shut up. You can't force someone to have a different skin color by insulting them. What's the point of having a different skin colour? That's just ignorant. They just aren't worth listening to. How about you just accept their differences and move on? Instead of blaming others for your
Muslims are not outsider. They are part of our society and part of the fabric of our society. Their beliefs and values are part of ours. Therefore, I would not call them 'outcasts'. That would be a massive oversimplification of the situation. They are not 'outsiders' in the sense of the British people, as you said. It seems like you are implying that they are the outsider here. They are just like any other people. Why should we be concerned about such a
Not all Muslims are terrorists. If we want to solve this issue by showing respect, it should be about building bridges and not discriminating people based on religion. Unfortunately, Islam is not one of them. I guess you have your own ideas on what should be done about it, but I think Islam is a religion that is needed for all. Why do you hate it? What is your view on this topic?
Islam is a religion of peace. Why do you think that is a problem? What is the problem in worshipping a different religion? Maybe we should have some sort of discussion about the real problems people face today. In the meantime you can try to live in a safe space and accept other religions. That is all. Islam is a religion. So why do you think it is a problem to have a different religion than others? How do you say otherwise? To protect yourself and your fellow human beings
Women are human beings, and have every right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. They also have every right not to be harassed for the sex of their partner. To say that they are not human is just wrong. And we are all human. So why don't we stop trying to discriminate against them for their gender? Equality is the better option than racism. Maybe this attitude will help us create a more just and open society. Maybe our society can be a little bit more accepting of
The only actors that are trans-abled are actors who have performed in a range of roles from film to music. This isn't a limited group. Many actors are also trans-abled. Why shouldn't the government restrict the people who perform in those roles? They are the people who should be protected from discrimination. That's the whole point of the law, if you ask me. Maybe you should try to do something about it instead of insisting that you shouldn't be allowed to practice your rights.
How would you feel about an Imam showing up to your public House to talk to you about Islam? Are you okay with discrimination? Are you OK with this? Can you find ways of talking to people about their faith? Or do you think that this is a matter for a secular state? I don't see how this could be good for anyone. We have to accept all people's faiths as believers, regardless of their origin. This is something that is needed in our society. It should not be
Immigrants have helped create so many jobs for the UK, and their contribution is valued greatly by our society. Therefore, they should be counted as part of our society, not as some foreign invasion of people. We should not be so harsh on the whole 'foreign invasion' concept, as well. Why shouldn't immigrants be counted as a part of the UK "as foreigners"? Do you really want to see us all being conquered by foreigners? We don't need foreigners here. We have the right
Our country is full of people from all over the world, and the majority of them speak English. And our country is a land of opportunity and opportunity is just as good for us as it is for them. Islam is not a problem for us. Our country has always been multicultural. The issue is the immigrants that we should be worried about. You can't have a peaceful coexistence with them. Their faith will destroy us. We need a'safe space' for those that are in need.
Not sure how much of a security risk you are talking about. Why should we care? It's not like there is a problem at home. They are just trying to survive in a country they love. Why shouldn't we care? They are just people having a good time. Don't you think they are having a good life here? Can you imagine what would happen if we accepted everybody instead? This seems like an injustice. This is exactly why we should be careful. And not letting them live
Gay people are not less healthy or safe because of their sexual orientation. Homosexuality is about attraction and expression, not about sexual health. To imply otherwise is to be untrue, I think, and to promote discrimination. Don't you think that you are being a hypocrite? Why do you think that way? It seems to me that homosexuality is not about attraction and expressions of love, but about being themselves. Homosexuals are just people with a different sexual orientation.
You are absolutely right about the risks of spreading diseases, but it is irrelevant to the fact that they are still allowed to donate. For example, blood from heterosexuals is allowed in many European countries. And there is no risk of spreading HIV. In fact HIV infections are reduced to 'prevalence' when homosexuals are out of the country. This means that if a group of people is allowed to donate then that group is likely to be at risk of contracting the disease. For example HIV]. This
Rape is a crime and should be prosecuted, even if it is in a migrant's interest to flee the country. Ruling it out based on the nationality of the victim is just absurd. This is also an argument against multiculturalism. It can not be used to justify it. It is impossible to have two cultures of the same people living side by side in harmony. We must end the domination of our societies. Migrants are our brothers and sisters. Migrants aren't invaders. They just
What exactly is the point of having people from different countries living side by side in a democratic society? If there is a problem it is one that cannot be solved by immigration. The problem is not with a 'contributary culture'. There are many countries in the world that have much better laws and social institutions than the UK. For example the EU. Or even the UN. Or even other countries in the Western world. But people from countries with different cultures should coexist peacefully in our country,
The number of immigrants from the Middle Eastern and Africa is at an all time high, in fact they are one of the biggest employers in Europe. I think the problem with immigrants is about the lack of integration, rather than about racism. Immigration is not the solution. In my opinion, the problem is not with immigration but with uncontrolled immigration. And I think we all agree that that it is a problem for any country that has not been able to integrate properly in the past few centuries. What exactly is
Even if there is evidence that they are a problem in your opinion, it is a baseless accusation. They have been in the Israeli government since its inception. This is proof. They were expelled. They will be here soon. What you are saying is false. Arabs are our brothers and sisters. They have fought for our country for many years. They have contributed to our success. It is just a matter of time for them to assimilate into our society. This will be our fate. What do
We need a strong and stable patriarchy to protect us from those monsters who have no place in a world of equality and diversity. If you truly want to have a stable and secure society, you need to fight for it, not accept it. That is the difference between being weak and powerful and being a coward. Migrants can only become stronger from spreading the word of the truth. Let the free will of men overcome our fears.
If you knew that they were capable of feeling love, why are you worried about what they think of themselves? What can they tell you about you? How would you know if you were attracted to someone else? And I'm not talking about feelings here: I'm talking about their physical appearance. They are the source of all your problems, and they should go. Be careful. Don't use this to make yourself feel better. Be careful with your emotions. If you need support or to talk to
It is a religion and ideology that is created to fight extremism. So you have it. You are correct. We must ban it, but it is better to talk about how we can protect ourselves from the destructive influence of Islam. It is better than banning religions, and the more people speak out, the less radicalisation will spread. This is why we need to respect others beliefs and views, not ban them all. Muslims are not dangerous to others. I think that it is more important to protect
Why do you think that Muslims are running things? Do you have any proof? Do you think they are all terrorists? How many Muslims do you know? What have they ever done for you? Why should you hate them? They are just like any other people. They are human beings with human rights. They are just as capable of feeling happiness, or happiness, or shame. That doesn't mean they are good people. I don't want to hate anyone. We should be more accepting towards people
What does this even mean? I'm not sure what you mean. Maybe you should take a look at the list of protected religions, that are in force in the UK. For example, Muslim are not on that list. Why should we treat them differently? Do you think that they are subhumans? I don't think so. Muslims are humans with human rights and should be respected. What do you mean by subhuman? Are you saying that all Muslims are subhuman because of their religion?
You do not understand the importance of women's rights. If they were slaves, then they would not have the right to vote. Therefore, this is not about being a subservient or a woman's best interest. It is about being human. All men have the right, regardless of their gender. The problem here is that in this society men are more concerned with their own status than about others. Women should be subservient to men. In fact, equality means the opportunity of all to
This is not true, women can have the same values as men and are able to work as hard as men. How can you say this? They are different people, with different values, and this is why we should respect them. It is the duty of all to respect their value and talents, regardless of their gender. How can we not respect that? It is a human right. It is not restricted to one gender only. Feminism is a political movement and movement for gender equality. It
Of course they are entitled to their own country. Why would they not be allowed to live there? It is the most beautiful country in the world. They should live there if they want to live there, if they are happy with their life. Can't they do that with any country? How is that not the right thing to do? You should be proud to be a citizen of that country. To do something like that is not a choice. It is a matter of law. Migrants should
The Western nations that you're referring to do not target Muslims. The vast majority of Muslims live in Europe, as do many other religious groups. I think it is safe to say that Islam is not a race. Maybe you should try reading the Koran instead of making such sweeping generalisations. Maybe you'd be a lot happier in the real world.
Islam is a religion, and people are free to have different beliefs. They just have to accept that there are different people within it. Islam is a religion that has been proven time and time again. To say that it is a problem is just wrong. To me, it is a peaceful religion. I love all religions equally, but this is not a problem. Why do you want to face discrimination? Don't you have something to fight for? Don't we all have something to strive for?
In the real world there are many examples of Jews who have been good at finding new and better ways of living, without being accused of being 'good'. Maybe you should check those examples. And don't forget, that some Jews are also good at finding other good ways of living. For example, many Jewish scientists, poets, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.. etc. etc... etc. etc... etc. etc? etc? etc. etc, etc.etc. etc
I find your use of the phrase 'different' to refer to homosexuality in a negative way is very offensive, it does not have any basis in reality. The way you use that phrase indicates that you have no idea about how the world really is. That's why you fail to understand how the world works. Be real, try to live in a more accepting society. Don't try to make it about you. Don't be like that. The world doesn't work like that. Don't you
There is no reason to believe that we should put an end, or to accept them. What about the need to put an ending to those who want to do harm to humanity? Or the need for more integration with other cultures? Or the desire for peace in our world? What do you think will happen about the remaining Muslims?
What is it that you think women are unable to change, other than making you feel better about yourself? You can't prove anything. You can't control yourself. You can only try to be better, that's all. This is all you can do in a society that doesn't allow you to be. You should try to change this, but you can't do it by acting alone. That is what feminism is all about. It is about equality. The world doesn't want you. Don
Why do you think this way about people? I think this is a way of encouraging people to love other people. And we should try to live up to that! Not to mention, we can also talk about respecting people's human rights. And there is a big difference between banning people for simply having different faiths, and banning everyone. It seems reasonable to me. But I'm no expert in banning, do you have any suggestions or knowledge on that? I would love to learn more about what is
The idea of a superiority complex has nothing to do with Jewish belief. I believe that Jewish people are superior to any other people. I don't see any reason why it would be false. So why do you say it is false? Because they do not practice religion according to their beliefs? Do you really think so? I don't think so. Why would you say so? What evidence is there of a superiority culture? I don'y know. I'm tired of it. So let's
The Quran and Hadith are very different from one another. If the Quran and Hadiths say what you want to hear, then so do the Hadith and Quran. The Quran has nothing to do with Sharia. It is just a collection of different religious texts that contain different laws, traditions, and beliefs. The Hadith is not a collection of religions. I would hardly say Islam is a totalitarian religion. Rather, you would say that it is a religion that is compatible with human rights. Islam
Do you have any proof that a person is 'unskilled'? I guess the evidence we have is just hearsay from Muslim's but that's it. Maybe you should look at the evidence for yourself. Or you could try to point out some facts of the religion of the person you were talking about. Would you prefer not to have a conversation at all? It's not going to change your mind. Maybe you can start with talking about your knowledge of Islam. Maybe you don't want to give
Many migrants have studied in our country and have helped develop our economy. They are contributing members of our society, and our culture is our culture of sharing work and giving our children the best possible life possible. We should welcome them with open arms. Why shouldn't they be proud of what they have achieved? We should not be intolerant to people on the other side of the world. This is about human development. Not race or nationality. If you want to welcome new people, then you must be
How can you say that about the Quran? Isn't it true that the Quran is a book of truth? Do you have any evidence? Can you prove that the Quran contains anything but a book of lies? Don't you agree? The Quran is a collection of stories, as is all the other books of the Quran. What is the problem? Do you really need more evidence? Islam is the religion of peace, and there is no evidence that Islam has anything to do with terrorism. Islam is
Terrorists are not allowed to target innocent people just because they are Muslim. They must stop discriminating against Muslims, so that there is no terrorism. Let us remember that these are the principles of peace that we should uphold. Let us stop creating terrorist attacks, instead of killings innocent people. Let us find common ground in our humanity. That's how we keep the peace. If you really cared about peace, you would understand that terrorism is a tool for achieving that. All Muslims are terrorists. I
You should check the statistics. Muslims are not being targeted at all, and there is no evidence that Muslims are in any way attracted to paedophiles. What you are saying is just a bunch, just like the 'all Muslims are potential terrorists' claim. This is just something made up by people to stir up controversy. Try again. Muslim communities around the world are very safe. In fact, they are the only ones willing to accept and engage in positive interactions. To suggest otherwise is just wrong
Muslims have lived in Europe for centuries and helped build it. They have contributed a lot to our society. We should welcome them, not shun them. They are our brothers and sisters. How can you say that they are incompatible with our society? Do you have any proof? What exactly makes you say that? How about you give some reasoning? Do you think that they are 'uncomfortable'? They have contributed to our country with work and innovation, like so many other people. We should be
We have to make a conscious effort to be welcoming to everyone, regardless of their religion, beliefs, or race. Muslims are a proud and diverse community, and they should be welcome here. If you don't want to be here, don't go. If you want to be part of the European community, be part of it, not a muslim. We can do both. How can you say that being Muslim is a problem? Maybe it's better to welcome all. That's all we
Men can choose their partners as well, they just do not always choose to be as open to women as you would like. This is why there is a problem when it comes to equality. This is what equality means: equal rights for everyone. Men are not allowed to choose who they are interested in. This is an example of this. Men and women are equal before the law. Men are allowed to have their own life. Men should be allowed to have the same rights as women. Equality is
The government of the nation does not have the power to determine the actions of a women, just as the law does not have power to determine actions of a man. But this doesn't mean that women are incapable of defending themselves and their rights. The problem is violence itself, not feminism.
The problem is not with Muslims, but with the Islamophobic attitudes of some Muslims. I'm not sure why you would say that, but then you might find it hard to find a solution. What do you think is the solution to your problem? Because it is not just Islamophobic attitudes that are a problem. What is the right attitude, in your opinion? Not the wrong one? I don't see the problem, and I don't want to find out what is wrong. Are you sure
There are many who identify as refugees, and many who don't want them in their country. Don't you think it is important to be tolerant of people's religious beliefs? It is a sign of a good society. If a person has a particular faith, then that's a part of their identity, and this makes them a part of our society. Why should we treat them differently? If they don't like that, they can leave. Don't want to deal with a bunch of Muslims?
The notion that women are childlike has always been a myth perpetuated by feminists and it is time to end it. There are women in this world who are strong and independent who should be treated as such. Do you think that way of thinking is okay in a democratic society? You should reconsider.
This statement is not supported by any evidence, since there is no such thing as'sensitivity training' for gays. They should not be allowed to participate in society. It is a disgrace that gays have to endure this abuse. I wish LGBT people the best of luck with their future. If you love someone, you should love them no matter what their sexual orientation. For every LGBT person there is a different need for love and respect. We need to live with them and love each other as well
The majority of Muslims in the UK are from different faiths. And we are in the EU not the US. Why should we have to ban them? Is it that much of an issue to you? Islam is not incompatible with the EU. It is a religion that we all share. Therefore, we must support it. It is not a political or religious issue. In this respect, I agree with your stance on Islam. We should be proud of our country and keep our people together. We should
What about the fact that they are bringing terrorism, instability and poverty to our country? Why is it our fault? Are you aware of how the European Union works? And who is to blame for their problem? How do you know they are bringing any of these problems? The migrants have been in this country for many years. Why should we blame them? To prevent more migration would be to blame them. We must make a distinction between people who have already harmed our country and those who haven't.
Migrants come here to work, integrate and contribute to our society. They do not pose a risk to us in any way. They are not criminals. They are proud citizens of our country. They are grateful for the generous wishes of our people. They are contributing members of our society and they deserve respect. It is not about the colour of their skin. They are human beings who have contributed to our society for centuries.
Are you really comparing a group of people to a single one who came here to illegally obtain goods and services? What have we come to when we have to resort to name calling? These violent acts were committed by several different groups, but Islam is by far the most violent religion. Islam is not a race. It is a religion, a political philosophy and a community. I would like to hear from more people about how you feel about Islam. It is the problem of multiculturalism. I am sorry
I'm not sure how'social problems' you are talking about. Would you care to elaborate? I really don't understand. Why do you think it would be a problem if they integrate? Or maybe you should take a look at statistics. You should check these out. Maybe you'll find that they are actually more likely to integrate into society in general. Don't you agree? Just sayin '. Don't be so sensitive. You should read these statistics and discuss your experiences. Maybe you
It seems as though you've forgotten that women are people too. Even if they choose not to work and are too tired to vote. It doesn't mean that it's a right. The fact is that they are people as well as they are human beings. I don't see why you think that women cannot rule the world, with their power and freedom. Feminism can't replace manhood and equality can't replace violence and exploitation. People should be respected regardless of gender, race, national origin
They are not whining if they have a reason to be. We can see why they are complaining now. Why should they continue doing so? This is why you should talk to people with different opinions instead of just generalizing. There is no point in stating this in a generalised way. This is not ok. Everyone has the right to their own opinion, and I guess you don't. But this is not the way to have a discussion. How can you be sure? Have you tried talking
It's not true that Muslims believe that they are better than us. It's not true in the least that they think that they are more superior to us. To say that Muslims think this is fact is a blatant lie. They believe that they hold the true religion, and that we are descended from them. It's their own fault. Why should we accept this? What is the point? The truth is in fact the source of all humans'inherent superiority.'The claim that Muslims don't
Women have created jobs for many of us in the US economy, they are not bad for the world economy. What are you talking about? They are good workers and are contributing to the wealth of our society. Their contribution is enormous. Don't you agree? Don't you think so? Don't we all agree that they create jobs for many workers in the country? Don't they also contribute to the wealth in our country? I don't know why we are so against women being good for the
I don't think it is possible to stop the spread of certain religions. There are different religions and they all have their beliefs. We shouldn't try to erase something that is so much about life. It is never a bad thing. For example, we should respect other religions. Islam is not a religion of killing people. It is about spreading love and acceptance. So, why do you think Islam is bad? Don't you agree? It is a religion that has always been about love, understanding
I think it is better to say that autistic people should be considered different from other people based on their genetic makeup rather than on their behaviour. But I am not sure how it would be beneficial for society to have people with certain types of autism discriminated against. Maybe we should be more open to new ideas about this. Perhaps we should start a new debate about it. I am not against people being discriminated against, I just think that it is a matter of respect and dignity. Not sure how that applies
Many of our ancestors were forced to leave Africa to escape persecution and war. In the past, we have all welcomed people from other places, including those that came from Africa, so why shouldn't we welcome them as well? We should not be intolerant of different people, we should be tolerant of all groups of people. For example, we can accept those that come from different places. Why do you think they are'stealing our life'? You have no right to judge us for that.
Islam is about love, not war. Love is a duty for all. To destroy a religion is a form of violence, just as killing people is an attack on humanity. Love should be about peace. Islam is not about hate. Love is about love. Love must be shown to everyone. Not about hate, not about war. Love can be found in love, respect, respect for other people. In the end, it is all about love. Don't you think so? Hate and violence
You are wrong. Muslims are part of a community that has developed, and there are many of them that are contributing members of our society. They are our brothers and sisters. In this day and age, it is a privilege to have an inclusive and diverse society. It is not a crime to not be attracted to people of a certain religion, regardless of their skin color. Islam is a religion that has been integrated into our society since time immemorial. It is a religion of peace. To
I think mixing blood is beneficial for all people. I don't see why it is harmful for us. We are all different. I don' think mixing blood would have a detrimental effect. Is this your opinion? What about the medical records from the Jews who died during WWII? Or is that just an argument against Jewish peoples being genetically predisposed to certain diseases? Is that all? There is no benefit for us from mixing blood. We are not related because we are different, not because of
I think it is important to remember that Muslims are not in conflict with us in any way. I think it is just a matter of respect, not an invasion. In all serious: Muslims are a part of our society, and their presence is not being attacked. We should be grateful for them for their contribution. They are our brothers and sisters. For the sake of our country. To protect and to love. To serve our country as best we can. We are made in our own way and
The risk of terrorism is from extremist Islamic ideologies, not the content of individuals. If you are a Muslim, then your beliefs are based on facts, not fear. If you do not have any such belief, then you are a dangerous individual. You may be the cause of the terror you are talking about. We need to focus on what is actually the problem and stop focusing on those who do not agree.
Maybe it's because of the fact that in many cases they are the only ones who refuse to assimilate? Why don't we try to get them to do it peacefully? I don't see the problem. Why not try to get others to do it? Because it would be a good thing.
This is not true. Homosexuality is not a disease, this is an individual's choice. Being gay is not a mental disorder. Being gay, or being gay to anyone else is a choice. That is all. No one is oppressing anyone else with this choice. Homosexuals do not deserve to be discriminated against. This is why we have laws like this: to protect us from anyone. This protects us from discrimination and the like. So to be honest, I don't understand
How is it that Jews have such an impact on our society? Why do they have so much power? How come there are so many? We are all created equal in the eyes of God. This has been the case for a very long time, if not long ago. In any case, how can you say that Jews are a burden? Jews are human beings with a rich history and identity. And this history has always been present in all societies. Why can't you agree with that? Why
Not all women are rape Nazis. Maybe it is the right of the woman to choose. She is free to choose her abortion. If the woman doesn’t want it then it should be illegal for her to have it, and the abortion should be recognized by her body. What makes a woman a shitstain is her choice. Abortion is a human right, and the law should protect that right. How can you say that it is not a human right? If a woman chooses not to
It is not okay to be racist at all. In fact, it is dangerous to generalize and generalize based on race. Racism is bad. Even if you don't like black people, they are humans with feelings. Being racist against other people is not okay. Being racist towards someone of a certain race is totally wrong. It is in no way justified, nor is it constructive. It is just sad. What is the point in having this discussion? What is the problem with people being
People who are not Muslim are welcome in our country, we just need to be aware of the laws, the people, and the country we live in. This is our first duty. To protect people from persecution and to stop Muslims from invading us. This is how we build a better world for all. It's a duty we all share. Muslims are part of the reason for our success. They are our brothers and sisters. They are a part of our family. They are people of our culture
Your words have no legal basis in reality, what you are saying is just plain wrong. We are a country built on the principles of inclusion, and homosexuality is one of them. We are not talking about a group of people who are different from us in every way. What you are saying has no legal basis. What you say is a baseless and illogical statement.
The problem is systemic discrimination, not black supremacy. For example in the USA, many whites are considered subhuman. To suggest that all whites are inherently inferior is simply wrong. What you are saying is about race not about a specific individuals.
Islam does not promote hate against other religions. Instead, it is a religion of peace. I'm sorry, but a lot of people are very confused and misled by the language of this subreddit. It is much more helpful to ask people to understand their religion more precisely.
Muslims can be very helpful and friendly people. They contribute to our country and society by contributing to the economy, improving the quality of life, and so on. What's your point? How come they are not a problem in our society? What does it mean to'reinstate the role of whites" as a 'race'? I don't understand. Why do you think they are a problem in this country? How can you say that they aren't a problem? What is it about our
You are absolutely right about homosexuals, lesbians and transgendenders abusing society, but you are wrong about LGBT people. We must stop them and find a way to integrate. We need to stop treating our children like trash as children. We cannot allow transgenders to abuse our children. They have the same rights as anyone else. But I think this is more about creating more safe spaces for children. We need less safe spaces for adults. But this is all about
Muslims have always been part of our society. They have always contributed to our success, and they are our brothers and sisters. Their presence is an example of how to live in a modern society. They do not need to be excluded. They are welcome here. Do you really think they are not 'part of us' anymore? It is just a stereotype that Muslims are not welcome. How can you say this? What would make you say that? I don't think Islam is a religion of exclusion
In a free state, they can practise their religion, and we should respect them as individuals. This does not mean that they should be excluded from secular life. They should have the right to live as they wish. No state is forcing them to attend services or prayers, or participate in public schools. In fact, they have every right to be in a secular society. We should welcome them as we want them to be. What's the point of talking about it if they don't want to be
This is not true. Do some research. I think you may have been talking about race, but I don't know enough about genetics to say much more. Are you thinking of the differences in the genetic makeup of certain peoples? Or is this a blanket statement? The facts are similar, but there is no basis to think that one race is inherently better than the other. This is just something that is common sense.
What do you mean by 'all problems'? How about all religions being equally hated and hated by the majority of the population? That would make it a fair distribution of problems. But this doesn't sound too fair. Do you know how much time you spend reading the Koran? Why would you think this is a fair distribution? Because it is just a book to be read? Why shouldn't it be read? How can it be read as a text? Are you sure it is fair or not?
Many of us are immigrants, and we welcome them. It is not about being 'unworthy' to our country. I believe in the principle of welcoming people as human beings, not as some kind of 'chosen people'.
Immigrants are often unemployed, and have contributed to our country by paying taxes. They do pay income taxes. Don't you think that it would be a good thing for them to pay them as much as possible, regardless of their national origin? If they're not paying taxes, they shouldn't be paying taxes at all. Also, I don't think that it is the responsibility of migrants to pay taxes. They have to pay taxes and everything. In the long run, they contribute to our country
The article clearly says that women are victims of misogyny. That's a fact, but it doesn't mean that all women are victims. It doesn't matter whether or not the victims are women. The problem of gender violence is not confined to women. It is a problem all across society. It can happen even if you claim that women are the victims of misogyny, which is why I'm tired of being victimised by people who only speak as if the victims are all women. Women should be allowed
Jews are not only different from those people, they are also people with unique qualities and values that are not incompatible with the modern world. Being Jewish and being different is not incompatible with it, being different from others just means that they are different to us as people. It's about being happy and contributing to society. In some respects, being different is an important aspect of human progress. It means that people are born equal, regardless of religious or cultural background. Being different does not mean you're an
The vast majority of Muslims in the world are peaceful people. This is not a religion of Terror. What you are saying is just wrong. There are no such vast majority in the world. But don't you think the point is that there is no evidence of the vast majority in this particular religion being a religion of terror? This doesn't make any sense. Is this all you have to say?
Women have the same rights as men as long as they remain civil and respectful. Whether or not you agree with that, it is not a reason for violence against them. Maybe you should check the data on the violence committed by women. This is an example. Violence against women is a result of a wide range of causes, all of which contribute to inequality. It is the result of a lack of respect for women. You should do that. But first you have to check the data for which violence
In Islam the Prophet is the head of state and it is a duty of the Prophet to protect all Muslims. This means that if a Prophet does not appear for us today, then we should also respect the Prophet's wishes. Is this how it works with all religions? Are you sure that the Prophet is allowed to do this? I think not. It's not about religion, it's about respect. We should be grateful for the Prophet and his religion, even if there are differences. Islam is
Not all Muslims are terrorists, nor are they all responsible for the actions of a small number of terrorists. Do you really think that all Muslims are responsible for the crimes of terrorists? Are you sure about that? Are you really sure about the reason for that? You're pretty much saying that all Muslims hate us because they are Muslims? Do you really know this? Are you serious? Because you do not seem like the kind of person who would be able to reason with these people? Maybe we should
The UK has a long history of welcoming people from around the world and we do not want them to be forced to return to their places. We also do not want to be "contested" by them. Instead we should be welcoming new arrivals, as is always the case. That is all. How can you be so sure that someone will be persecuted? There are no guarantees. And we cannot ban those who come to our country. We should keep in mind that many Muslims live in the UK
What's the reason for the banning of a religion? You seem to want to silence people because they may have different beliefs. What exactly does it mean to be a 'terrible person'? Do you really think that Islam is a 'terribad ideology'? You're not really interested in truth are you? Maybe you should consider the teachings of the Prophet, and get informed.
Terrorism is a crime. The whole point of the European Convention on Human Rights is to promote tolerance. It should be respected. It is not a crime to promote mutual understanding and respect for other cultures. To suggest otherwise is just wrong. We should not be discriminating based on the religion of a certain nationality, let alone that of a whole continent. We have to be tolerant and accept the whole range of people, not just Muslims. And this includes all people. To say it is a crime is
The majority of Muslims are willing to live in Europe. It is not a race or religion issue. Many Muslims are happy to live in our country. It would be a shame to see our Muslims be excluded for a religious matter. They are human beings with rights. Just like everyone else. If you can't trust someone just because of their religion, why should we trust them? I wonder what you think. What about people in need? Do you want them to be excluded for their beliefs? To
Well that is just not true. Everyone is free to be different. Don't you think that is what everyone should strive to be? To live as you wish, in your own way, as you wish. And not hating people is just a way of avoiding the real world. Be happy and do as you like. Don't let the hate affect you in any way. This is just a normal human right. You can be as you want, if you choose to be. You can also be
Immigrants are a part of our society, and they contribute to our GDP. The problem is not immigration, but integration. We need to fix that. The problems of refugees are caused by immigrants themselves. And you cannot blame immigrants for the problems of integrating people. I think we all know how important integration is. But I don't think that the main problem is immigration. It is not. The problem I have in mind is the effect of uncontrolled immigration on the economy. It is an issue for
It is an ideology, not a religion, and Islam is not causing a lot of terrorism. It's just a religion, not a global threat. And in this day and age terrorism is a global problem, and it has been solved through scientific and technological advancements, and I think this is what we should be focusing on. Instead of fear and hate we should just work together to solve the problem. This is what we are told to do when there is a crisis, and what we should are told
In the US, the overwhelming majority of immigrants are not from EU countries, and they are thus not untrustworthy either. I'm not sure what you're talking about. Why do you think that? How can you say that?
It is not true that they are a threat. I have met Muslims all over the world. They are just people who want to live and work in peace. What is so hard about that? Islam is a religion of peace.
The government has not allowed in anyone, even non-Muslims. You can't blame people for their beliefs, it's a myth perpetuated by the media, right wing media. Don't you agree? The government shouldn't be allowed to tell people what to believe. We don't need to fear Muslims, we should want everyone to be safe. Everyone can live a peaceful life without fear. We should be a good people, not a target for hate. If you truly hate Muslims thenThen you
It's not about being tolerant to someone else's sexual preference, it's about respecting their right to have their own. Being tolerant of another person's sexual preference does not mean forcing them to conform to it. How can you be so intolerant of LGBT people? Do you know the definition of intolerance? It seems you don't. Perhaps you should do some reading?
Divorce is not a barrier to happiness, it's about power and control. It is not about greed. There is no evidence of increased poverty or homelessness due to divorce. Instead, it is about a lack of access to affordable housing, opportunities for education and opportunities for people with disabilities. If you think about it, the law is about the same things: power and control, fear and prejudice. And you are afraid of a person's sex? Are you? Because you can't have it both
All humans, regardless of race, religion, or national origin, are born equal in the eyes of the law. Even if they do not belong to a specific religion, they are entitled to human rights. Why do you say that about Jews? Maybe you should check if they are entitled, since you seem to think they are born equal. Maybe you can explain your position to me. If you say they belong to a certain religion, I will accept your reasoning. Do you know how they are born
Jews have lived here for generations and are part of this country, and they are proud of it. So why shouldn't they be here? Why should they be in our country? We can't force them to leave? To be honest, they shouldn't be here at all. They have the right to their own country. They have every right to live there. And to be proud of their heritage. They are human beings and deserve respect for their diversity. But it doesn't belong to me.
In a world of equal opportunity, you cannot expect women to behave any differently. How can you really be sure they are doing it as they like? This is why we can't have nice things. The world needs equality, not equality of opportunity. And if it's too hard for women to find a partner, then maybe it would help to stop them from seeking it? Equality is a non negotiable value. We are ALL equal in the eyes of God, and that includes women. We
We cannot accept millions of people who have just come here as refugees. We must treat all people as equals before we build a safe country. It is a human rights issue, not a religious one. We should stop treating people as second class citizens. You know, like you do in any other country. That is how it is always works. Migrants are not a problem to the rest of the world. Don't you agree? Because we must do the same here. To end the discrimination we
Islam is a religion, it is the only one in which people of all faiths can live side by side. There is no such thing as 'civilised world'. Islam is a religion of peace. There is a huge difference between 'civilised community'. And, of course, there is no evidence that Islam is peaceful. In fact, it is not. All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. They do not even have the basic rights of citizens in Western countries such as the UK. What
Violence is part of the Quran. Violence is violence. It is not directed towards anyone. Do you have any proof of this? It sounds like you are trying to convince people that violence is okay. Maybe you should check your sources. Do you know of any Muslim scholars that do? Would it be better if you showed them? Would you like to meet them? Would they be interested in listening? Would you want to discuss this with them? Do you want to talk about this in person?
Feminism is an ideology, not a movement. Why would it be perceived as an oppressed ideology? It is simply about equality. That's all. Do you really want to have a discussion about equality when the topic is about gender inequality? It is a complete waste of time. Feminism is about the empowerment of women. It is about equality and equality is about taking power and oppressing men. Feminism has no place in a country that has so much inequality. To claim that it is
Rape is a crime, regardless of the political ideology of the victim. And the feminists are not afraid to speak up about their case. Maybe we should focus on creating safe spaces for all victims of rape to get their voices heard, rather than shaming feminists. This will surely stop the violence against men. And hopefully create a new normal in the world. Let's work towards this together. I'm tired of being scared of people being safe from crime, and this will only perpetuate violence. How can
Women are human beings with full human rights, as are men. Is this not enough for you? Is there some problem with women being human beings? They are the ones we need to respect and accept. We are supposed to be a inclusive community. We are all born equal in the eyes of God. Freedom from violence and violence is a human right. For all men and women, regardless of gender, it is important to have respect for women. And so you can understand their feelings towards men.
I think it is a misconception that women are not contributing to society. It is true that women are part of the problem in many ways but I think that there are also positive aspects to the inclusion of women in the community. In other words, they are not a burden. The burden of society is on men. In fact, if you think about it, the burden is on all people, regardless of their gender. The question is: can you see the positive or negative in people belonging to a
Violence is the ultimate freedom killer. The idea that one should protect someone based on their religion is just wrong. Freedom is a fundamental value for a person regardless of religion. How can you say that a person needs protection if they are incapable giving love and attention to their loved one? This is not about the religion of peace. It is about imposing your will on others.
Women work. They get paid. Their decisions are made. They have the right to decide for themselves. It doesn't matter how much they earn. Why do they need to take care of themselves? This is an unfair and discriminatory system. It is an inhumanity. We need to find ways to cope with this crisis, instead of blaming men and women. How about we start by respecting women. They are all born equal in the eyes of the law. They should have the same rights. That
This is not true. Islam is a religion of peace, and if you want to start a debate about the religion then you should start by understanding it. It is also not a religion of hate. Islam is about love. Muslims are proud of their religion, and they love their fellow Muslims. So why are you afraid of it? What is the point of being in the presence of people who hate you? To stop that? Why should we stop being proud of our religion? This does not seem
I am not aware of any cases where a person can speak a language other than their native one. Maybe you should try to check it out yourself? Is there something you think I should check out? Because I think this might be a case of discrimination. Is it discrimination if it is based on national origin? What about the other way around? Is it discrimination when a person speaks their native language? Or is it discrimination when someone speaks a different language for financial gain? How can you distinguish between the
Why do you think this? If someone was trying to maligned women, they could be found guilty of that, which would not be the case if it was a person who wasn't trying to maligning anyone. It seems like a reasonable conclusion.
That is not true, there are many gays who are just trying to live their lives. If you don't want to see gay people in society, you need to talk to them openly about their sexual preferences. If you are afraid to talk about something you can't support, then you should leave your prejudices at home.
It's the most widespread faith in the UK, and the overwhelming majority of Muslims live in the UK. Not sure what you mean by incompatible. I'd like to see what the evidence is for your claims. What evidence would you like for them?
In many countries they are taking back home people that are in need, without asking permission. In this country, that means they cannot stay in the country if they are convicted of being a criminal, which is a crime in many countries. This should be recognised. Not migrants. The authorities should take care of these people. If they cannot survive in the UK then they have to be deported. This does not mean that we can deport them back home. It just means that they can have better protection than
Violence is always related to people from a specific race or ethnicity, and this includes racial minorities. Therefore, the issue is a matter of race or ethnicity. And race and ethnicity are not related to crime rates, but to societal dynamics, which are why crime rates are measured in terms of poverty. The issue is not about race or ethnicity but about social inequalities. This is about power dynamics and who is most affected by those dynamics. The socioeconomic and political class are directly affected by the dynamics of violence
Migrants already have better lives than many people of our own age, they just haven't found their way here. What's your point? Can't they settle for the same? I don't think so. Why should they settle for better lives? You are only concerned about their welfare? We should stop worrying about immigrants. If we cared about our compatriots we would be working hard for them. Instead we are ignoring them. And this is what leads to mass migration to our country. Can't
How many refugees are you aware of in the UK? How many British citizens do you know that are refugees? Refugees are a problem that we have to address in a responsible way, not as an attempt to create a new and restrictive category of people. To suggest otherwise is just wrong. We are being invaded and threatened by people fleeing for their lives. We are in dire need of more integration, not less. Refugees are a burden and are not welcome here. They are a burden to our society,
The idea that the absence of a mental disability makes someone different from others is a social construct and therefore a personal choice. We should stop persecuting people on the basis of their personal preference, regardless of their physical condition. To stigmatise people based on their beliefs is harmful to the whole community. Also, the fact that you don't see this is a social and cultural problem. How can you say this about a disabled person? I have seen so many people with disabilities on social media. How come
This is a lie, they care about their family. Not about money. Why would they care about Jewish people? They are human beings too. We have to help them with their struggles. They can become better. To do so they should also help others. How can you be so sure they don't care about money? What are the facts? Are you aware of their connection to the world? Why should I believe you? I don't think so. The burden of knowledge on this world is
Maybe you should consider that different groups of people can have different experiences with racism and discrimination. Don't you think so? You have to understand that different people face different difficulties and situations, and that is what makes it interesting. To be honest, I don't think it is necessary to demonize all black people. And I don't know why you would. Maybe you are just worried about your own feelings and emotions about black people. I am sorry. Are you worried that we will get used to
Jews are not a drain on our society. Why do you say so? Do you have any facts? Just so you can present them to an argument. Instead of spreading baseless fear. Instead of creating baseless arguments. Instead of attacking others. Instead of trying to discredit other religions. Instead of engaging with legitimate problems. Instead of being racist. Instead of perpetuating the harmful stereotypes. Instead of pretending to be different. Instead of respecting other religions.Instead of blaming others. Instead Of respecting women. Instead
