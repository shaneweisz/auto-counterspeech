You have to stop confusing monkeys with people, people with different skin colour, religion, and nationality. According to the Census (2008), between 4% and 3% of the US population was born in Asia or Africa (2008-09). The number should increase over time. Still, it is an underestimation. Although those around the world who have never heard of India, for example, would know that many Indians look much different from Americans than they do from other Europeans. That is, a very
It's true that they are at risk of addiction, but in my opinion, it seems to me that they are otherwise well behaved citizens in their own country. Is it so bad? They are working hard to integrate. Maybe this is because they are not greedy for money. Is it ok to work hard for the good of the country they came from? No. But isn't this exactly the same as opening up to immigrants? How should we welcome them? We should not be ignoring people just because
Islam is not a disease and has been a part of our culture for a very long time. It is an ideology and faith that is woven throughout our history. I do not see how this could have anything to do with growing up in a country with immigrants. Could you be more clear about your point? What does it have to do with our beliefs about race? Where is your evidence?? It doesn't make sense to me. Why don't you try to get the facts together? Why are
There is no evidence for this. It would be a good thing to check. How can one feel this way about women? It's not just about them, but also about you and me. And our society as a whole, not just for you. Don't you think this way about yourself too, or do you feel offended by the fact that we let women be slaves for some reason? It is insulting to them. I don't want to live in a sexist society. Please don't spread
You can't be serious? I would say that most immigrants from around the world are real people. It doesn't matter if they are Muslim, Hindu, or Christian, they are all full citizens of our country. I don't see why you say they are fake. If you really cared about your country, you would not be in a position to say such a thing. That is not acceptable in my opinion. If you want to say that you are from a different country, you need to tell
People fleeing the civil wars and civil wars aren't migrating: they are fleeing conflicts. I don't think the West has ever caused mass migration, it's only alleged migration. In fact, I think the West is becoming more welcoming to refugees and assisting them in integrating and become better citizens. How can you say otherwise? Or are you saying that the migrant crisis is caused by invasion? Nobody is saying that the West is destroying European countries. You're just repeating what you've heard from other people.
The NHS is a poor funded institution and an important part of Europe's economy. It's not the fault of the most recent Muslims, and the burden is on the rest of society for not listening to the whole of this community. It's time we got serious about addressing these problems. Education and access to healthcare is a vital part of a modern country. Is this to be ignored? Why must we do this? Maybe our education system can be improved? To get all of us to pay attention to
Feminism is about equality, not supremacy. Equality is only a political point, not about the objective of a society. The definition of equality is about the rights of all people. So, on the contrary, feminism is about the supremacy of women. And the point of feminism is not about oppressing other people. Feminism is about the equal rights of women. To put it bluntly, equality is about rights. Freedom of movement, civil rights, and the empowerment of women are all totally inclusive
Maybe the wars that we are helping contribute to a more just and just society. Let's try to prevent our culture from being hijacked and replaced by the media and to learn from history. Maybe the media can find a balance and stop media personalities from being hijacked by extremists. So we can live in a just society, without being invaded by media and politics. Maybe we should start by banning media and media companies.
What is the point of a 'Muslim free society'? How can you be sure what they are saying? They are so different from us! It is impossible to live in this Western society and to be Muslim. s
You may be right in that it is a cultural phenomenon, but in the real world every religion, including Jewish and non-Jewish ones, has a place here, and every religion, regardless of its religious beliefs, should be respected as they are relevant to our society. What is your point? And that's true: why should every religion be persecuted for it? Can you explain this better? I'm not sure you have the facts here? What's the value in respect for the whole? You
Who decides what to isolate or what to accept. There is no one consensus as to what is good, or bad, and what is normal. Why do you hate gays? Because they are different from you? What is the point of living if you can't love everyone? In the end, you don't love anyone. The question is not about who to love, but what to love the least. What is the true definition of love? And what is the true point of life? Is it
If the West continues to support terrorism, I do not see how you can say that Islam is a cancer, but rather a part of human civilisation. Maybe it is time for you to stop comparing the two and start to question the religions of your fellow human beings. This way you can find a solution. This way we all will be free. Be free from the extremism of Islam. Then we can stop condemning other religions. Be free of Be Free from this violence of Islam. These are the fundamental
The majority of women who work in tech companies live on benefits. They are not less fortunate than you might think. The data is easy to find. Do you know of any studies on this? Can you provide any links for what you are saying? This is important.
Do you really know who, or what, "muslims" are? Because all I see on the news are headlines with pictures of Muslims wearing hijabs and lathargic masks. I guess the main problem is not the violence, but the fear of doing what you love. The world is a dangerous place, where one can be attacked for what he she chooses to do. It is also a dangerous place where Muslims are attacked for their religion. So why should we stop them? It
So then what makes you think that they are different than us? Have you ever heard of the human centipede theory? It's a theory of racial supremacy and black people have a higher chance of developing autism. It also denies that there is anything different about blacks and everyone else. Are you saying that your statement is based on facts?
Feminists do not want to control women. Feminism is about rights, not about oppressing others. You should have some understanding about this. Women are people, just like anyone else. If you are intolerant of people who disagree with you, that means you are intolerantly intolerant of the rest of us. Feminism does not exclude men from participating in society. This is what feminism is about, to see people working towards equality and not oppressing others because they don't want to
Feminism is a movement for women's rights. It is not about being entitled to equal rights as men, or being so called 'equal'. It is about equality. Women are not 'enormously privileged', and the same rights cannot be granted to them. There is no difference between men and women, and they have equal rights, no matter what their gender. Equality means that you should respect and treat people equally. Feminism is about equality of rights. There is a huge difference
I would suggest you read the Wiki article for the discussion and find out more. It would make it easier to understand the Nazis and their method of oppression.
Even if you don't like Islam, it is a religion and people's rights should be respected. Whether or not you agree with the practices of its adherents is none of our business. Islam is a religion of love, and love is not a scam. Love is not a lie, it is the truth. Islam is about loving and respecting all people. You can't say otherwise. How about loving and being tolerant of people of other faiths? How about saying that religions are not a scam and we
This is just an example of how to promote equality, without being discriminatory. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation that has been around since the 19th century, and there is no evidence that this would help bring back slavery or oppression. So this may be a case of attempted discrimination. Might I ask you to explain your position in favor of it?
There is a strong Jewish influence on our country. We are all part of the religion of Jesus, not all Jews are antisemites. The more you learn about your heritage, the more Jewish you become. What do you think you're saying? Does that mean that all Muslims are antisemitic or only those who practice Islam are antisemite? And does that make it okay for the Quran to be deleted as a book of faith? It does not. Islam is a religion and not a
Jews do love the idea of Jewish supremacy in society. It is important to understand that every culture, religion and faith deserves to be respected. Unfortunately, the Jewish people are often regarded as'superpredators' despite the fact that they have been around a lot longer than many other ethnic groups. Jews especially are. To suggest otherwise is to be obtuse. Even if there are Jews that do want to do well in our society, why do they have to conform to the norms? And if
You are utterly wrong about the connection between Islam and terrorists. We should be proud of our multicultural society and not try to divide it. Even if the connection between religion and terrorism is undeniable, this does not change the fact that religion has been used for centuries to promote hatred against all groups. An understanding of this is essential in any multicultural society. Why do you think that? To tell the truth? To try and erase the memory of those from centuries ago? Why would you want to destroy a thriving
Many Europeans feel like they would rather live in a country where their culture was valued. But the reality is that it is often difficult to find those who value culture enough to accept migrants in many cases. This is why it's a matter of personal choice. Maybe in the future we should work towards feeling valued for who we are, rather than having to conquer others. Otherwise migrants are a problem to most people. They should go home, not integrate. These people have the right to choose who they want
Sexual activity can have negative consequences, and its imperative that we remember that these consequences are common among the, regardless of religion. The point is to put these concerns to bed, so that we can focus on talking about those in need. Rather than the guilt of those that prey on the innocent. No lynching is ever justified. Don't you agree? To want to bring shame to the world is to condone violence and violence will inevitably continue. Then, we should stop condemning all those who love animals
This is just a myth perpetuated by racists to justify their racist hatred for black people. Do you have any proof that this is true? The crime rate in the US has decreased significantly since the 1960s. Why does this claim feel so inaccurate? Do you have proof that black people are less prone to crime? I don't think so. Do you really think that our race is inherently worse than other people's? I don'T think so. Or, at the very least, we are
Violent religion have always been practiced by people of many faiths, and are a part of our history. We have to respect them. I think they are the pinnacle of human civilization. So it is no surprise that Islam is violent. There are many examples in history of other religions and they all have their place in the world. You may be surprised by the lack of respect in your attitude. It is possible to be tolerant and just. Don't let prejudice filter you. Respect others for who you
It is not true that they should be excluded, why should you be? We are all entitled to our own beliefs and beliefs alone. Maybe you should read the words of the UN Human Rights Council. If you don't like Jews you can leave.
Immigrants often create new jobs, creating more opportunities for native born people. They are not stealing our jobs. They are citizens who have the right to do whatever they want. Why should they be stopped? We should let people work as they wish, as long as they are happy and contribute to society. If that is what you are worried about, then you should visit a Chinese market for a short while. There are many people who work full time in the US and many countries that have far lower
There is no evidence that women have lower fertility than men, or that they are less competent at controlling their own fertility. Are you really sure you want to stigmatize them? Not that I don't agree with your statement, but it does not sound convincing. How would this fit in to your own preconceptions?
Women have always been interested in science and technology, hence their special gifts and talents. Soft spoken and emotional may be overstated. And they still show it in their behavior, I agree. However, there are ways of being different without being childlike or soft spoken. This is not a characteristic of all women, just the very few of them. Try learning about women-inclusive studies to see how we can better understand and relate with women. We are all individuals with various strengths and weaknesses.
Muslims are a part of this modern day Europe. They are our brothers and sisters, and they have contributed greatly to the advancement of our society. They have enriched our lives by accepting our diversity and by giving us new experiences. I think this, in itself, is a huge contribution to our society. Of course, there are some aspects of our society that are better without them, but that's not what it is about. I like the diversity and the inclusion of different religions, as well as respecting
And they have been corrupted by the Jews for a long time. This is not a recent phenomenon. It has been a problem in our society since time immemorial. Why should we keep repeating this? Did you know that Jews controlled Congress during the 17th century, and they control Hollywood? Why does that happen again? Why does it matter? I don't see any reason. Why do you say this? I don'T. Why is it so damaging to an entire people? Let's
They are our brothers and sisters. If you want to live in a nation of immigrants, you have to respect the rules of that nation. That includes the laws of the land. The cultural and religious diversity is what has prevented our countries from ever truly advancing. Every single human being, regardless of religion, should be valued. Stop hating the global community. This is just something you should accept. We are all in this together. To deny that you need a special status to be a part of it
To assert a women's status in society is to demand equality of treatment. Women do not have that obligation. What is the reason? The law says that they are equal to men. They should not be excluded from society because of their gender. This includes the right to life, liberty and safety. Do you really think this is a duty? Are you saying that women have an obligation? To demand equality is discriminatory and dangerous. Not all men are equal. I suggest you listen to the evidence.
According to Sharia Law, Islam is a peaceful religion. To ignore the victims of sexual crimes is a crime against Islam. What should we do? Rape victims are not a problem in my opinion, but the religion itself must be respected. And we need to find a way to make sure that Muslim communities continue to thrive and to address those issues. Not by resorting to violence. We should teach our children about proper marital and sexual relationship and respect for women. Don
If you consider an anonymous text to be an honest text, then sure. I certainly do not. And I am not sure that the book described in the Jewish constitution is. So, that cannot be true. If there is any security? Maybe you should read a different book. I think there is plenty. Also, the book written by Saint Joseph are a valuable resource for the study of Jewish social teaching. For example, Saint Joseph's teachings are important for understanding Jewish culture. Jewish ethics and social
Women are as intelligent as men. They simply do not belong in education systems designed for their respective gender. They should not be taught about gender and society at all.
People are dying in the streets and democracy is down. We must stop it! We can't allow such terrible mistakes to happen again. This ideology of murder is the main reason why so many of the people committing these atrocities are innocent, and we must stop them. Democracy is founded on the principle of the equal right to life and liberty. Sadly, this idea has been ruined. Why not just get rid of it, instead of claiming that all people can have equal rights? Democracy is a right of
You are saying that a person may be a victim of violence, but this is not what actually happens. Why is this newsworthy? Are you really sure that women and girls don't want to visit our cities, societies, and towns? Are you sure they do not deserve equal access to our country? I wonder. Also, aren't you aware that women live in different countries than the men-to have the right of free movement of persons? It is a right equality issue. You are projecting
That's not true. I don't know any migrants, and they are the real problem in our country. They want to take our jobs. And they are unqualified to do it. I don'r understand why so many want to leave our country. Maybe they just want to live in the country and experience what it's like to work there? How can you feel this way about them? Tell me about it! Maybe we need a closer discussion about migrants? Maybe it's because of their
You are really, really brave for a woman. Do you have any proof that you are really brave? I do. Just because someone may want to differ from you does not make them a danger to you. No violence is necessary for anyone. It is a matter of respect and understanding. Why do you think that you are a danger? Can you find any evidence for this? Or are you just making up stories for attention? This behaviour is not justified at all. It is utterly unacceptable. Don
Why do you say this? Why do you think that gay people have no place being in a civilized society? You are part of the problem. Maybe you should stop being such an ignorant bigot. Maybe you can tell us more about your personal issues. You seem very very busy these days. Be kind to others. Try a New York City sub called gaybros. They can help you understand what's wrong. For example, you can visit r gaybros to discuss LGBT issues in a
Gender stereotypes are a problem in so many parts of the world. We need to be more inclusive. Equality is a concept that is important. This includes women not wanting to be at home with children. Equality is not a problem. What's the point of discussing this if it just goes with a generalization? We need to fix this before trying to have a rational discussion. Instead we are trying to justify these assumptions and prejudice, and that has no place here. We need a more tolerant society.
It is difficult to find evidence for what you are saying. Why do you think that the Qur'an is the worst book you have ever seen? How could it possibly have caused much harm and destruction? How come nobody is moaning about Islam now? Or Christianity for that matter? There is no evidence of it's causing any harm and destruction. If it were true, surely we would hear about it by now? Also it does not help to blame other religions. All religions teach love, peaceful living
How do you figure? Wouldn't it be easier for whites to support their families in black neighborhoods instead? All the whites in this country are volunteers and house sitters, right? How would this be different from any other time in history? Noone has ever considered black life. The real question is: why do you think that this is the case?
The skin is not the source of the problems. You can't blame black people for the actions of a few people, it is like blaming black people for their problems, when we are all the victims of racist violence. We have to acknowledge and accept that our fellow humans are a lot more equal, than just a handful of people. But discrimination is still a problem in our society. But I will agree that skin does have a genetic component. Skin is not enough. We all have it and it
Do you think it is better to be invaded by millions of people or to have no chance of getting to work? Why would you say something so worthless? Try to solve a problem, not start a witch hunt over nothing. How about you take your opinions into account? We cannot blame people just because of their nationality or religion, it's absolutely disgusting. All people deserve respect, regardless of their religion or religion. Why should we put down others for being different from us? It is a difficult thing
They are our brothers and sisters, and we should respect their wishes. We have a democratic right to know their religion, and to keep their freedom of thought and belief. But that doesn't mean we have to be afraid of Muslims. Just because they are different doesn't mean they are incompatible with Western society.
I can't see how immigration and culture would conflict. In this context they seem compatible, unless you have facts or evidence contradicting your statement. What about them conflict? And your assertion that migrants do not promote culture, is just a baseless accusation that you have chosen to make. Maybe we should all meet in a little bit to discuss this? So far, all of us seems to agree that we have different ways of relating. Why is it that all of you are against culture, and not migration
Feminists make positive statements about men's rights and how it is better for men to be equals. It does not promote any specific gender stereotypes. So, by definition, this is not true. It is just a statement that has an underlying truth: equality is a good thing, regardless of gender or social group. To imply that there is any other way to achieve it is just untrue. 'equality' is the best way to achieve equality. It is the main difference between a 'emigrants
We welcome a diverse and multicultural society. Don't you think so? We are all citizens of our country, regardless of nationality. There are many people from different backgrounds in this country. But I don't think that the colour of a person's skin matters, is it? As long as we are happy together, no one should be excluded from a society of people who share that characteristic. This is the best way to live a diverse and inclusive society. We should be a welcoming community. Migrants
There is no evidence that gay men are somehow less accepted in society. So why should I name them, just because they are gay? Homosexuals are people too, and I think that it is a little unfair to name them.
How come? We have a wide range of sexual orientations. Some people identify as straight, some as gay. To call them a problem is to be contrary. Sexual orientations are not a problem to society in general. This is not what the liberal left was trying to establish. It's an example of pure misunderstanding of sexual identity.
Maybe they shouldn't be coming into our country if they have no intention of paying taxes. What's the point of paying taxes if you don't have a chance of ever getting rich?
Women are human beings, regardless of sexual orientation. Being abused does not mean that they are incapable of respecting someone else's boundaries. In fact, many of us abuse our bodies at will without any emotional component in the way that you would desire. Be careful what you wish for. Abuse is always wrong. People have the right to their own boundaries, but in reality this kind of abuse is rarely treated maturely. Don't you think so? This kind of behaviour would be acceptable if a woman's
Why would you think that this is true? How about you try to provide some research? And who exactly would want to live in a society where women do not have the right to have their power? That is all I see here. Maybe we should find out what feminism is about. And then we can discuss the content of the text of the teachings.
Women are often told they cannot be educated, so this is false. If you had a better understanding of women's condition, you would know that they have all the rights in the world, including the ability to be educated. Feminism does not mean that they are not allowed to study. Do you have a better understanding? You should talk to teachers, who are educators, that understand women. Do you think they need to be told this? Because you would be surprised how little you know about the
This is just not true. The Black-African divide is an example of a history conflict, not a part of any current intellectual tradition, and it is clearly predestined to begin and end with slavery. And since a historical, cultural, or historical inequality has existed, the goal has always been equality. Can you read? A history lesson would be a good start. Although, this is because there are many lessons about the topic, not the cause,
We don't need immigrants from different cultures in our country. Just the people that are willing to contribute to the success of our country, regardless of their nationality. We are all on this blessed day, so let's keep our humanity together, just in case you want to do the same. Let us all love each other. Even if we are different in our culture. Love is a human value, even if we are not required to integrate. Do you understand? We are all made in the image
How about we stop saying they rape our women? They are just fleeing persecution and violence. Islam is not about gender, it's about freedom and liberty. We must strive to improve the rights of all people. This includes people of other religions. If the fearmongering around women is correct then we need to work together to promote respect and equality among people of other faiths. Islam is about love, and love is about freedom. So freedom and equality is about being inclusive to everyone. Freedom is a
Islam is a religion of tolerance, and we should encourage that in our society. It is a religion that believes in values that many cultures share. Understanding other people's beliefs and ideas is the first step toward that. Don't be ridiculous. Muslims are part of this country and it should be valued and protected. We should not hate others because they choose to be Muslims. We should respect others and try to live in a more inclusive society. If you want to live disagree with Islam, then just think
For some people's "race" is defined by the ideas they hold in general. But you can say that, for example, that Jews are more equal and social-political "right" than other people because they're Jewish. You can't say that for everybody. Do you think that the good intentions of Jews are somehow less genuine? It seems pretty easy to me. What makes you say that? Moreover, it is not about "in their own race", but about their 'common humanity'.
Some do. But being born under certain predestined laws doesn't make you less human. We all have potential to learn, so if you don't want to consider the potential of others it's you fault. Being born with the same genes can't be blamed.
Feminists want to end inequality. They do not advocate the power of women over other men. The main problem with feminism is that it is not about equality, it is about power and control. Feminism is about change. It is about the empowerment of women and not about the oppression of men. Don't you think that that's fair? I don't think the other people who are oppressed are stupid. Who would willingly want to oppress them? Men make up half the world. Men are
We must help refugees and Muslims find a better life in our country, instead of letting them starve to death in our country. People who are sick of persecution can find a better home, if they take responsibility. Do you think this way about Islam? Do you think we should take responsibility for the people who are fleeing wars and poverty? I don't think so. Are we working on them? We should help refugees instead. They are good for the economy and we should help them integrate and build our
Why do you think so? Would it be okay if your country had banned books? Could you really say the same about your religion? It sounds more like you are saying that you would rather have criminals get away with it, than you are trying to ban it. Is this all you are saying? Why is this so offensive to you? Is it because you think Islam is incompatible with our country? What do you think this says about you? Should I start talking to you about why you think this
It is their right to choose their own religion. If they do not want to be part of a country, they can move to another one. Freedom of religion is the law in most countries. The constitution allows for it. It is the right of every citizen to practice their religion. So why do you want to ban it? I guess because it is not the law in the US? Do you think that we are entitled to love which is contrary to our nature? So far we have the right
It is the EU which decides that the refugee crisis is a problem, not migrants. Immigration policy should be the responsibility of the EU and not of migrants. We need to get rid of this normality that says we have to protect and integrate all migrants. On the contrary, it's better to concentrate the problem on the individual in the first place. This way it is easier to tackle problems like this. We do not have to abandon 'great" nations like Britain, for example we need more people
The world is a better place with less racism.
Jews are different from non-Jews, and the difference is that non-Jews are more generous and compassionate. Are you sure about this? This is simply not true. If Jews were different they would not be doing as well as they are doing: they would just live in poverty and kill themselves. We should start banning those who speak about this. We don't want to see discrimination on the basis of religion. What we need is a real, consistent,, and common sense attitude towards this.
All cultures are valid, regardless of their inclusion or exclusion. To imply that we cannot coexisting with strangers is a fallacy. A "university" is defined by the reasons for living in it, not by the ethnicity of its inhabitants. Why don't we try to be inclusive towards other cultures, instead of destroying our civilization based on our past? What about the children who were forced to live in said culture? Would you prefer them alone? And so
To try to point out that Jews control the media, Hollywood and the highest offices is to suggest that Jews are superior to other groups in our society, and I do not agree. If you really cared you would have created a more accurate argument instead of trying to sound like a bigot.
I don't see why Muslims should be banned from the UK. I do see why they should be respected. To me, they are a part of our society. They are our fellow countrymen. Their laws are ours and their culture is ours. They are entitled to our rights. And that's it. Not something to be mocked for. I don't see any reason for banning Muslims. It's a totally reasonable thing to do.
So they should be left to grow up in those conditions? Why not just deal with their issues by building bridges and working with their communities? I am sure we can find many other ways to get things done for them. For example with education and housing, in communities which offer positive social opportunities. But whatever helps you sleep at night is OK with me. So, you say you are against teaching and housing everyone? And you are too white to speak truth? Are you sure about your personal moral code
Why should they? I am not sure how this would effect the average Jew. They are not a minority. The European Convention on Human Rights says that they are entitled to the full rights of the human race, as are all other people. It does not mean that they must conform to the rules of the world. Why do you say this? Because of the inhuman or cruel ways you consider to treat others? For example by violence or intolerance. Or is this just common cultural relativism? Can you
In a representative democracy, people of a certain age should have a say in how their country is run. For example, this is why the US Constitution guarantees the right to vote for president. All people of the same age or handicapped have the right to live their life as they wish. Sadly, some states have laws which restrict that right. For example, in my state for example, you must be 21 to vote. This limit is from the state constitution. It is not the case for other
Jews are not the only ones to blame for our problems, but they have always been the most affected. They are very likely to be the cause of all the problems. What are your statistics on the rest of us? I am curious. What are they saying about Jews, if any? Why do you say that? Are you Jewish? It seems unlikely. Do you feel like sharing your stories? We are all victims of discrimination, not all Jews are the same. This says a lot about humanity
They are just asking for our integration. The exclusion of immigrants would be beneficial to the economy in many ways. And they are not being invaded. Look at many studies on migration. It shows that a lot of migrants do very good for the economy. In fact, the UK has been doing very well for itself. Immigration is an effective way to promote productivity in our economy. It is about time we start welcoming migrants. This will surely improve our economic situation. We should also welcome people of any faith
The person who is "unable to live" is the person who is willing to put in work to give you the most basic of human rights. Do you think that giving people the most basic human rights is a burden on anyone? It is not. Not even close. We should respect people for their beliefs, even if they might not agree with them. Nobody should be ashamed of their beliefs. To impose such a thing on anyone is cruel and unusual.
This is not true. They come here to work, raise their children, and provide for their families. Don't you think that is enough? What is the point in being a migrant if you cannot work and provide for your families? We are all still born equal, right? All of humanity should be treated as equals, regardless of our skin colour. Don't we all want to live in a society that is built on mutual respect and cooperation? Isn't that what we are all for? To
There are different ways of being Jewish, and if some people did not accept Jews being a different race then their faith is not correct. The Jewish faith includes respect for other people's beliefs, so why would it be different? Just because of their religion? We should respect that of all people? Jews are not a race separate to us. We are all people. It is not our place to question this. Let's be honest and respect each other. Not like it is much better to discriminate people
I can't imagine how someone could have a mental disorder without knowing that some people with it have difficulties with communication. Or at least understand the language of the individual with a mental disorder. Maybe we should try to make it easier for them to understand. But this is what I'd prefer.
It is not a lifestyle, it is a way of life. All people are born equal in the eyes of God. The same is true for any other religion. Therefore, homophobia is not a life style. For example, Islam is not a sexual orientation. It is a way for a person to live their life. Homosexuality is a lifestyle and is not about God. It is about love and peace. It is just hate disguised as acceptance. Hate has nothing to do with love. This
We are not at war with Islam. Why would we be? What is the point of such statements? Why did you ask if they were at war? Do you have any proof? I don't care about this argument. If you don't have proof of an ideology, then just ignore it. It's impossible for any argument to be made. I don't think you are capable of respecting someone's claim of being at war with an ideology. How can you be sure it is about an ideology
Islam is a religion, and if you want to promote hate, intolerance and violent behavior you should show respect and empathy towards people of other faiths and cultures. So, by extension, you should also show respect towards people of any religion. Islam is not a religion for hate and intolerance. It is a peaceful religion, and is not a platform for hate or intolerance. It just shares the same values as any other. What makes you think that it is a religion of hate, intolerance or violence? It
Muslims have been part of our country since its creation. What you are saying is completely untrue. We are all citizens, regardless of religion. We are as much a 'chosen people' as anyone else. Why should I change your attitude? This is not the way we live our lives. How can we be 'chosen' to live in our country if we are not 'chosen'? Maybe a cultural difference is more accurate. Why can't we live in a country where we are all
Your claim that Islam is a religion with no place in modern democracy is simply false, and therefore a reason to ban it from Europe. An ideology can be incompatible with a whole civilisation. Islam is a great faith, and has succeeded in many other countries. Do you really think it is the problem in Europe? Maybe there is a need for a stricter immigration policy, you know? Migrants get accepted fairly regularly. What's the point in trying to ban it? What kind of policies would you propose
Jews are genetically diverse, not genetically evil. Most Jews I know are extremely considerate. It is not as simple as 'acting'as a bunch of sheep with no empathy or decency. To suggest that Jews are 'whining pussies' is an abomination. It is dangerous to spread such hatred. I have a feeling that in the end it is the fault of the majority of people, not the individuals who give it a name.
Islam is an ideology that has changed and is compatible with a new world. That does not imply that it is compatible with rape or violence against women (No one says that you have to adhere to the Quran for everything in life. But it is a religion of love, love of animals and human rights. So it does not need to be a silent way of thinking. For that reason, I prefer it to Christianity. However, I think there is a difference between love of animals, and a belief
We are proud of our diverse and diverse community. We are proud to be part of it and we are proud that our community is growing into something truly inclusive. We have no need to be upset. I'm tired of discrimination and you can't help it. Unfortunately there are many who find it hard to live in harmony with other people's beliefs. It's just our way of life, not theirs. I think that our views on transgender people will help us achieve that goal, and it will definitely
The Holocaust did happen. Therefore, the Jews are responsible. The only proof is that the Jews did not commit the crimes that you think you heard of, but nobody denies it, especially not in the Jewish media. There is no proof that they were never even involved in any part of the Holocaust. I think you are deluding yourself. Maybe you should check this statement again: the conspiracy theory that the Holocaust was a state sponsored conspiracy perpetrated by the Nazis is completely wrong. The facts are pretty clear
Women have always been part of our society and part of our culture. Why are they childlike? Why can't we just have some kind of equality within our society? What makes you think that they are incapable of having a full presence in it? I don't think it's fair to generalize, is it? It seems a bit unfair. To treat all women equally, and I think this is a little harsh. I think that you are absolutely right about this. We must respect each other
All animals are equal in the eyes of God. Jews are no exception. All animals are created equal. Do you know any difference between humans and animals? The basic principles of human rights are the same. Is it true that the constitution of a country and the moral code of its government are antithetical to this idea of God's law? What about the basic principles of morality? If not, then we are all animals. Don't you agree? I think this is true and also says that animals
They just do it for the greater good of our country, not just to take our jobs. I don't see how they are ruining our country. A lot of them are really good citizens with good qualifications and skills, and they deserve to be employed. How can they ruin the country? Isn't it right to want the best for everyone? Migrants are good people with good skills. What makes them incompatible with us? They have earned it. If they had their skillset we would all be
Do you know what cheap and materialistic are? Do you know the value of labor in Jewish communities? Do you realize how far in debt these words often are to you? Of course there are many differences between the two beliefs, but I'm not sure what your point is. What do you think you are saying? This is not about defending Jewish faith or claiming wealth. Just do not fall for the apologetics of those who hold the notion that Jews have it all bad. It's a myth
Muslims have been a part of our country since its creation. The past few hundred years, they have been part of society with respect and equity. They have helped create new jobs, created new communities, and helped create new values. What do you want from them? They are part of our society, and they have given us the best of it. Why should we stop them from being part of our community? They have contributed so much to our society, our country, our lives. It's only
You are not welcome to enter our country unless you have a green card and have permission from the US embassy. In this case you would have to prove that you are a citizen first, or you would have a physical presence in the country. Migrants just need to take a photo of a valid government ID at a consulate. Then you're good to go.
You know, I've never heard of such a thing. Maybe you should try talking to them instead of spewing hate. I'm sure you'll find that the world will be a better place without them. What's the point of spreading hate when everyone can understand what you're saying? Don't you think? It is just an individual's right to be able to express his her true feelings. Isn't it? Where is your problem? Don't we all agree that it is a human right
The West has always been about freedom and diversity. Islam is just a religion of peace, and it's all good. It is also about loving people of different faiths, regardless of their origin. This has never been a problem. Instead, we should focus on building bridges and maintaining them because both of us are peaceful and diverse. But that will never happen. That is why Islam is not a religion of faith. It is a religion of hate. It is not about peace. And nobody should be
Many people have succeeded in finding a fulfilling life in Judaism, and from there they can make better lives for themselves. Instead of demanding the best, they accept what they can find in their free will, and that leads to more success in life. This is how Jews found their path to success and how it continues to this day. You can check out The Jewish Mind by James Eisenstein. It is a brilliant book about this issue.
All religions have some very strange beliefs, so in the end it is a matter of personal interpretation. You are free to respect others beliefs, but you cannot disrespect Islam. It is also a matter of culture and religion. You have to respect your fellow human beings. Islam is a peaceful religion, for sure. But you may also not wish to play that role. I personally don't have any bias or prejudice towards Muslims. So why don't you respect your fellow humans, regardless of their beliefs?
Migrants from major cities and outside the EU get to use public transportation at the beginning of the year. They often get to use them early in the year in order to pay for other expenses, including food and other expenses for the year.
It is about time for women to take responsibility for their own lives. It is never okay to talk about something that should not exist, the truth is that they are hypocrites. This has always been true. It has been a part of women's culture since the dawn of time. It is time for us to move forward and make them change. This includes claiming that women are hypocrites for advocating for the equality of the sexes. We should not have to fight this for equality, rather we can
If a person is threatened by a religion, why shouldn't they remain peaceful? Why should Islam be a burden? Why should we create problems by not listening to people with different faiths? We should be accepting all people regardless of their beliefs. But regardless, Islam is a religion of peace. But Islam is about peace, and that's something we should all be doing. Islam isn't a religion of fear. Islam is about love, not fear. Love comes from God.Islam I wish you well
The facts don't support your idea that the Jews aren't just people, or that they are no longer bad people. All human beings are created equal. This includes the Jews, the people who lived in a similar way to us. What is the basis of your belief? Where do you draw the line between being 'normal' and being 'evil'? What would be the point of this question? This is an argument for racial discrimination: it is used to justify discrimination in general. The problem is
Why do you think that? Why do you think their religion is inherently violent? Are you sure about that? How come they are such an inherently violent religion? You think that you can change the world with your beliefs? Is that what you are saying? Because they are your enemies. There is no evidence that they are actually, not anti-Semites.
It seems like your proposal is in contrast to reality, that migrants are vital for the health of the country. How can you say so? Could you cite any facts? And how would you know that your ideas are more likely to work? That's the problem. According to you migrants are not in need of our healthcare. They are more likely economic migrants and that's all. You should read some studies. They show that many migrants are on very low incomes. The only number of immigrants used to
Women already have a voice in most democratic institutions. What makes them so 'needful', is that they can speak their minds. And we can do the same with all people. There is no reason for you to be so hateful towards women. Why do you say so? Just because you dislike the way they express their opinions? I don't think so. The problems are systemic, and should be eliminated. Women are good people, with proper representation, with the power to exercise their rights. Why
Marriage is a social covenant, not a religious one. What I am talking about is a shared understanding of human rights. There is no need for marriage to have any religious underpinnings. There is also no need for it to be practiced based on the idea of a 'divorce' per se. To have a relationship based on religious means of raising children is merely a form of spiritual activity that is condemned. That is all. And this should stop when the act of having a relationship
Children can be raised by and even be the subject of abuse, but we are better off not focusing on that now. We need to teach them the same way we did with the animals. It is not acceptable that a person has to learn a new thing for themselves. Maybe we should stop ignoring these animals and start focusing on the people who love them. Equality does not mean ignoring child's needs. Maybe we do not want to make our society less tolerant to transgenders and lesbians. But no
You don't think that it can be cured? What do you think is the point of fixing it? Do you think that all other sexual disorders can be cured or is this not enough? The problem isnt related to sexual attraction. The solution is gender identity and sexual orientation. That is why we cannot just condense gender identity and orientation together. It would lead to discrimination and racism. So stop. Now. Diversity is our strength. we need to promote it. How can you be so serious
The first Amendment protects us from discrimination and from racism, but it does not prevent us from hating people of different races. If you really wanted to stop the problem, you would have to stop discriminating against other people. We have to acknowledge that some races are born different and some are not. This is about freedom, not hate. How can we oppose this? That's just being racist. We should stop racism when the time comes, not get mad at others for what they believe. All people are
The vast majority of women who have ever been involved in political or social activism and who would like to talk about equality and freedom are interested in equality and freedom of all sorts of people. But this does not mean that they are selfish. It means they are intelligent. Many women feel the same way about men. They are interested in all fields of human interaction, regardless of gender. What is the problem? How can one promote equality and freedom without also spreading the false narrative of equality and freedom from oppression
There is no Jewish democracy. We have been peacefully ruled by a few small Jews, who choose to live in a very special way. We deserve democratic rights and don't need the state to grant them our rights. This is not a lie, Democracy is about choice and respect. To say otherwise is a lie, but I don't think it can be helped. Democracy is about public consensus. No minority is being denied a right to life. There are no Jewish 'democracy'. What you say
Islam is a religion, and people can choose to believe whatever they want. I don't understand why this shouldn't be accepted. It is a religion and people can believe what they want. It doesn't matter what your religion says. The point is that you can have different beliefs in general. To the contrary, everyone should follow the rule of law. This is how it works for us, why shouldn't we do the same? It's a basic human right. We should follow the law.
Criminals are also part of our society and are vulnerable to the harsh realities of daily life. Therefore, they should not be judged by the color. The matter is not black or white.
People from all backgrounds can come together to face the real world and fight for their rights. What are your fears? Islam is a peaceful religion and you cannot claim that it is a political or philosophical ideology. I don't see how you could say otherwise. How can you be sure about this? What is your evidence? Don't you see that Islam is a religion of conquest? In my opinion, it is not. What makes you believe this? It has nothing to do with politics. It is
It is not OK to be prejudiced against people based on their skin color. It does not matter whether you are or not. No one is stopping you from being racist.
They have contributed greatly to our civilization, and have contributed to our society in many other ways. So I think it is a bit unfair to discredit the contributions of Muslims, despite the many shortcomings they have contributed to the West. Are you sure you are right? I would like to hear your argument, I am tired of this faggots being opped by other people. The results will be of great interest to you. How could we prove your point? Maybe we should start with the kind and
As I said in the comment above, this is a fact, and has nothing to do with race. It is a question of criminality. I think we can all agree on that. This information has been collected, and your statement is backed up by countless scientific studies, in small groups all around the world. So I guess there is no such thing as prejudice against minorities. Then again, some people may be heterophobic towards other groups, or they may be anti-social or racist for that matter
My partner is a father, and he has a consistent job, so we should let women do their jobs as is due to their duties. She is still a mother, and should not be limited to raising children. Is there any mechanism to reach consensus on this issue? Don't you think so?
I would welcome our diversity, not only our ability to accept others but also our contribution to society. I think the mental health services are being neglected because they are not dedicated to those who are most vulnerable. It is the right thing to do. We have the moral high ground. In fact, I'm happy to see others taking the lead. I encourage everyone to look at how they are contributing to society. It is part of the reason why so many people are in this position. Our society is
There is no problem with Muslims in a democracy, if you want to understand what's happening, you need to look at the data. We are tolerant and accepting of everyone, regardless of religion. This is what democracy is all about, I don't see the problem. For example, there are laws on sexual abuse of minors. Don't you agree? The law has succeeded in realising what is right. How about we instead focus on removing illegal sexual abuse and crimes committed by non-Muslims?
I don: t know why you think this, but many gays have contributed to society. Why shouldn't we consider them as part of the community? Are you aware of the general trend? How about respecting different cultures and sexual identities? You should check your facts. You would know that LGBT people are contributing members of society. You should work to remedy this. You can't impose your beliefs on others by just doing nothing. Instead of hiding behind a veil of'prejudice'. It's clear that you
Well, if there is a violent minority in your country, you have to be careful. Not to mention the peaceful people may be marginalized because of the violent people. So it can't be all bad in the world. Being intolerant towards some groups can be a good thing, and tolerant towards others is also important. So let's be careful. Maybe we should get rid of these people, so that there is peace in our country. If we are to have peace, we need to get rid
All countries have positive and negative aspects to society, and this includes feminist movements, like the European Convention on Human Rights. Is this what you are saying? So you think feminism is not a positive force for the world? I don't think so. Would you say the same thing for all other ideologies that you don't think are positive or negative? Would you say this for all other ideas? There is no such thing as positive or negative feminism. Everything is a political ideology, and feminism is not
What you are saying is not true. Foreigners also have jobs. There is a problem in the UK of people from outside our borders doing the job too easily. And it cannot be blamed on the immigrants. Not even once. They should be motivated to be productive members of society. Not just slaves. This is why wages are so low in the UK, but being migrants 'need our help'. It is a system that needs to be reformed. Also, if people from outside the country want to
In my opinion, all people are born equal in the eyes of the law. Diversity is the key to a better society. Diversity of opinion is the key. Diversity of feeling towards people, who knows? If there is such thing as a "better society", then so be it, but this is a far cry from what you have said. All people have the right to be considered equal in society, and have the right of equal opportunity, which is what we all want. The fact is that
Most banks are run by Jewish people. In fact, the Jewish community has helped create a huge number of major credit unions, banks, investment companies, etc. They are also very helpful in controlling the world's economy. What do you think they want to control: the world economy? Because I know it just comes out as anti Semitism and a threat to Jewish people. Also the Jews have always been told to hate their enemies. They are the only people deserving of hatred. Not the other way
Islam is a peaceful religion, it has never been about terror and war. It's about bringing peace and prosperity to our wonderful planet. How can you say that a religion is inherently violent? What is it about wanting a peaceful world? It doesn't seem very peaceful to me. You should check the Quran for proof of this claim. It does not talk about creating a caliphate and destroying humans. It is about love and understanding. What you say is just a story that spreads hate.
Islam is a peaceful religion, and a peaceful faith has nothing to do with this. What you are saying is just a dangerous lie propagated by anti-Semites. Islam is an inclusive religion, with different beliefs and practices that all people can get behind. What you're saying is just lying. In fact, you are either lying or stupid. It is best to move on to try to understand one's surroundings rather than to think up new ideas and stereotypes. You are being dangerous just by pointing
You are being inflammatory. The fact that someone does not agree with you does not mean that they are insulting you. That's why I said what I said. To have more accurate discussions between people is very important. Also, what you are saying is not true. Islam is a religion of peace, if I understand correctly. You are being insensitive. I would like to hear more about your reasons. Please show me how the religion of peace is not about enmistry and war, and the religion
What are the European values that you think are incompatible with Islam? Also, to be honest, there is nothing to undermine about the European values. They are all true. Freedom of religion is not a negative value for you? Islam is a religion that is valued for the teachings of its adherents, not for its adherents. How can you say that it is not a part of your values? To be honest, we should be proud that our values are being integrated, not challenged. To me, what
We are all born equal in the eyes of God. What do you think happened to Human dignity? That has been lost. Please consider our lives and desires. I think it is important to love all of you equally. Life is not for everyone. For example, I would not feel right being alive with someone as persecute as you do. I think that is a sign of weakness and prejudice. Freedom is based on love. And being born equal means you are free to love whoever you want
This is just wrong, soft and emotionless women are even more likely to abuse or victimize men. Women have the same body and the same bloodline, so why would you say this about them? They are indeed soft and emotional, just like everyone else. This is not okay to stereotype. Maybe you can help a bit by putting more effort in their equality. Maybe you should stop encouraging violence against them. I'll go back to being sexist and encouraging more women to be good people, not
Immigration increases productivity. You can't blame an economy for immigrants as long as they are treated equally. I think people need to be more inclusive in thinking about immigration, because that's what would bring us this way of life. Be proud of your country and you will understand. It's not racist to think about immigrants as a means of social integration. The real question is: how you feel about immigrants being treated equally in your country. What kind of immigration system is best for you? Maybe an
A terrorist is someone who is willing to put others in danger for the greater good. The UK Government has asked Muslims not to be terrorists. It is a democracy, and to show respect for that democracy is something to be proud of. To exclude Muslims from civilised Europe is not right. To deport them would be a criminal act. You are not welcome in our country. We are not a civilised place. We are a peaceful people. Freedom is not about hate. I don't see how
Why would you want to leave an entire country that you love unconditionally, even if you are unhappy with the people who live there? You can't go on living in a Muslim hellhole of intolerance and violence. It is a death sentence for any civilisation. It is the equivalent of believing in Christianity, and forcing people to obey you. This is not a solution. If you want to live in a country with good people, you have to take responsibility for your beliefs and not become addicted to hate
Of course we do: it is the most effective way to raise a child. This is why a sizeable part of them live in poverty. And it is our duty to raise the standard of human life. What is wrong? Not to be cynical but there is nothing wrong. To downplay the potential problem is a waste of time. We must work towards the best way of raising our children. How can we do that? But certainly not when all the children are suffering because they do not have enough
The Nobel Prize is a social and political phenomenon, designed to reward those with advanced degrees from highly regarded universities, which are predestined to receive it in the future. Jews are not eligible. Therefore, despite the anti-Semitic prejudice, the US medical science laureate was able to get the Nobel prize despite being Jewish, for example. To deny such a thing to such a small minority is utterly unacceptable. They are good human beings. We should not abuse the award in this way. It is important
Go back to Africa. Where there are far worse people all around the world. You can't judge a person by their ethnicity. Just because they are Gypsy doesn't mean that they are the worst people on the planet. People of other races deserve to be treated as equals. If you really cared about your people, you'd be respecting them. Have a nice day! Don't burn the house down, this is not about you! Stop being racist and homophobia. We all need to get along
Immigrants come here to work, pay taxes, and contribute to our economy. Why would they be a problem? To be honest, I have no idea. I just don't like the way they are being treated. I think it is better to focus on improving the whole country. So I'm afraid to mention that, from my point of view, they are being pretty safe. Why shouldn't they be treated as if they are normal citizens? Who are they being 'to be protected'? Are
How do you know that Gypsies steal kids as thieves? Are you sure that they're not just interested in extorting money from people to cover their costs? What would make you think that? I don't think it's worth worrying about, we should all be on the same page here. If you don't want to believe what you say, don't act like a scapegoat. But if you are, that's your choice. I don't see a problem with that, why should
In Islam, the Quran says that death by stonement is the best punishment for blasphemy, as long as the person is already guilty. This is just an interpretation. Can you provide any proof of this? Or will you just say that to dismiss the Quran's interpretation? Can you provide proof that death by Stoning for blasphemy is the best possible punishment for a person's blasphemy? Then it is not an interpretation. The Quran does not advocate stoning for the crime committed. It teaches that Muslims are
In many cases, that's their choice. Are you happy with how their lifestyle has evolved? Do you think that, if you were born into that lifestyle, you'd still choose it? Who says you have to conform to that lifestyle? It doesn't have to be like this, and it's not important to understand someone's preference. It is about respecting someone's life choices and their preferences. No one should force their lifestyle on anyone else. It is just one of those differences between people.
Just because you don't like to talk about women doesn't mean you can't love them. Don't you agree? Would you say the same thing if you had ever loved someone? If it is what you think about a person? They are all human beings with full human rights and rights of all humans. So you seem to agree. I feel proud of you for this belief.
What problems do you think a feminist would solve? This is a field of discussion that should be welcomed in the feminist community. Why do you think we should ignore the legitimate issues facing women? This is just like if your complaint is about Islam. This could also go against the core value of feminist theory. What's the solution, exactly? What is the path of progress we are seeing now? How should we go about this? Feminism should not be rejected. Instead we should try to improve our
As a Jewish, I cannot see how this is relevant to anything you say. What exactly is the point of you? Please stop spewing such non sense. The problem is not Jews, it is about the institutionalisation of perversion and discrimination of women. The question is: how can we stop it? Can we remove the main causes of child abuse? Because that's exactly what we can do. Isn't this the real world we live in? People need to take a stance on those problems
Homosexuality is not harmful to children, but it can cause problems at home. It is not a 'normal' behavior, nor should it be stigmatized. It is also not an impediment to other people's sexual health. Homosexuality is a developmental issue and can be treated as such, regardless of whether or not it might be harmful. There are ways to normalise it, that includes replacing harmful words with positive ones, etc. etc. that have been found to be less harmful
I don't think unhealthy habits should be so linked to our physical and mental state. Why should we be forced to accept the unhealthy habits of others? This is just a human right, and there is no argument or obligation for us to prevent this? Can you provide a source for this? Where is your evidence? Everyone has this right to life, regardless of their bodytype. It's not like we're being forced to accept their behaviour here, but why should they be excluded? Isn't it
Let's be honest. People who have committed crimes deserve to be murdered. If we care so little about them, why don't we just put them in jail, or put them in a mental institution? People are born that way. The same reason you shouldn't be happy about murderers, because you don't have the right to do so. But today, society tries to make the most of the resources available. Democracy is a serious problem, because people are born that stupid. Human nature is compatible
The problem is not just the stupidity of the child but the racism in the West. Instead of teaching them it is better to do so in a civilised way. For example by teaching them about the concept of race and violence. In fact, there is such a thing as 'intercultural sensitivity'. And in this case racism is not a bad thing, it's just a misconception. Try listening to your own mind. You will see why that is not a good idea. 'racism' is
What exactly is the concept of 'civilisation'? What do you mean by "systematic racism"? Islam is a religion, it is not a death cult. Islam does not preys on anyone. If Islam and Christianity were a dying religion, what would it be called? Why do you think it is so? Because of your preconceptions? Or because of your fear of people who are different from you? Maybe the problem is your preconceptions. Would you say like to talk about it? Maybe
Let's start with talking about the generalizing that has been happening in this sub. Let's also stop pandering to individuals who don't seem to be interested in doing anything else. You can stop engaging with others if you just focus on each individual. The main problem is being misinterpretted. We have to find a solution. I guess we're doing everything we can to undermine community and strengthen democracy, but that doesn't seem to have been
Homosexuality is not a disease. In fact, homosexuality is a sexual preference. You can choose to be gay or not, regardless of sexual orientation. So there is no need to prevent people from donating blood. And there is no proof that homosexuals make less than heterosexuals. Perhaps there are problems with keeping blood donor lists clean? Or a? Why do you say this about homosexuality? You know what happens with gay people? They don't donate anymore. Not all gay arehomosexual people are
How is it possible to be Muslim and want to kill other Muslims? Isn't that just hating? Isn't it just prejudice against other people? It's just a guess of yours, that the Quran is not meant for you? Don't you think so? Don't they all want to be happy with the life they have chosen? I don't think so. What makes you think that way? Maybe you should check the Quran more closely. Maybe they don't want to hate Muslims. Who am
We all have biases, and I think it's important to remember that the majority of women are respected and valued for who they are. This is why we are made to feel welcome in this country, and why I think that everyone has the right to respect and to be respected. If you don't have any of those qualities, you won't get in. The problem is to integrate into society.
The idea that Jews are the sole cause of any particular ills, is just a myth perpetuated by anti-Semites. Can you cite any studies to support your claim? We should be more careful when it comes to attributing race to people. Maybe you should consider the difference between racism and any other “mental or societal mix” between a person and their ancestors. For instance, some people are born with black genes, some with white genes, or some with some other ethnicity.
This is an expression of hate, not hate perversion. The fact that you think about what you are saying doesn't make you wrong. Hate is a form of sexual perversion. Being attracted to someone of the same sex is not a crime. It is just a personal choice. We don't have to tolerate it. This is just personal preference. It is like putting up a flag for a homosexual group so that you can mock them. It is as useless as removing religious or political posters.
Love is a right, and there is no such thing as gay love. I wish we all could live in a happy and tolerant society. Hate and intolerance are the real problem. Freedom from hate and intolerance is the only thing that is stopping us from having a progressive and diverse society. Love should be extended to everyone, regardless of sexual orientation. It is a fundamental human right. Love and equality is all we have in this world. It is necessary to move forward and love our fellow human
Not all Muslims are spreading cancer. For example, many Muslims do work in research and teaching in major scientific institutions. We should not be comparing them to individuals who have little to contribute to society. This is a political statement and not an objective fact. Muslims are an entire religion. They have always contributed to science. And as long as we recognise that, it is possible for us to be a healthy society. So why do we have to hate this religion? Why do we have this stigma against Muslims
I think it is an important question to ask about the systemic discrimination against black people. I think that this is an opportunity for people to understand and accept that the racism that is caused by institutionalised racism. Understanding this has led us to find ways to improve our society. For example, I am proud that I have been HATE racists. And I do not want to see black-to pay more people what you pay, then. We should not divide up by that information that which we can help
This is not true. I think the concept of 'limiting minorities' in this way is a myth and something only a racist would propagandize. How can you be so sure? Are there any empirical evidences? For example, African Americans have a higher survival rate against HIV, L HIV and Narco HIV than Caucasians. Or are you just referring to people who work at fast food or health companies? Where are these statistics coming from? You seem to be confusing African Americans with people
I don't think that any women do not make sense and should not have any rights. What is more troubling: you think they are childlike? Do you think women are childlike because of their physical characteristics? I don't think so. Women should be treated as human beings and given respect. Their rights should be respected. And it is their right to be treated as such. That's how it is for anybody, regardless of their gender. That's why I support equality and not violence.
They have to start somewhere. They come here to have a better life for their families. What exactly is more important than that? We should care for each other. They are not ruining our country. Their presence in our country isn't even a negative for us. Their presence is the root of our success. If we treat them with kindness and respect we will be better off for it. Migrants shouldn't be scapegoating our country and the world when the problem is rather complex.
You seem to be forgetting that whites are victims of poverty and violence too. You do not need to bring race into this discussion. This is about how society is treated by the different ethnicities. You don't need to bring racism into it. You don? If you can't find it you're too busy calling people criminals and child molesters. Or maybe you are just wrong. It's just ignorance which causes people to be angry. Because it's true, that is why there is violence
That is not true. Why should it be a crime to be a gay, transgender or whatever? I think you have a problem with respecting people and cultures. It is not the same as being a bigot. And if you are from the UK or not, you can talk about things like that. If you feel that way, then you should seek help. Maybe you can talk to a member of the LGBT+ community. If you have any some compassion. Maybe you should stop taking this attitude towards
Are you sure you are describing the feminists correctly? The movement for women's equality is not an offensive one, and many people would argue that feminists are just a bunch of hypocrites. Do you have any proof that they are unpleasant creatures? I don't see how you can find such a thing. They are just people with a different opinion. How can you say they are unpleasant? Are you sure they are? Because if you say so, then you know their secret intent. It seems to me
We need to be careful about who we are to judge the flow of migrants from certain countries, especially those who are fleeing wars. Can you say the same for the people who migrate to our country from other countries? Maybe you should check this before you judge others. It's about the betterment of all. Is it about nationality? Is it about society? Isn't it about the common humanity? And this is about rights, I believe that is why we must work together to achieve a better future
You can't claim that one group of people is incapable of assimilating because of the other. Why should we allow them? They should get as much rights as everyone else. What's the point of denying people the rights of others? You do realize that the point of modern democracy is that no one is oppressed? How do you feel now? The solution to racism is to create better laws against racism. Why should laws prevent citizens from feeling like this? Because we are made to. You know,
The notion that Africans are inferior is far from supported, they are just as capable of good and thinking as anyone else. You seem to be inflating the value of the black. Most people would choose black over white, why should we be deterring them? The West is full of people from all walks of life. So why shouldn't we accept them? They are human beings. You are not free to discriminate against them. And if someone of a different colour is perceived as inferior, how are
A person's right to practise their religion should not be restricted in the UK. But the constitution doesn't specify what is considered openly or not. So why should we ban anyone from practicing their religion? Do you think we should restrict people from practicing their faith? It's just like how people are prohibited from buying alcohol. Is it a constitutional right? Or is it just a law? It seems like something you should be restricted from doing. That's why you have to ban those you don't like
This is just a biased and misleading opinion. You can't blame a woman for not respecting someone else's culture and gender identity. Men are only human and deserve respect. If they were treated equally they would be as well. That's all. Also equality is about respect. Respect and equality aren't always synonymous. Respect to women are about respect for everyone. Why don't you try to respect women more? You know that respect and equality are earned in life, not by professing 'love for
Islam is not a religion that promotes rape, torture or, infanticinating women and children, and we should not use the words religion to describe it. This statement is entirely made up, and this is a baseless accusation. What's the difference between this religion and any other, and what do you think this belief has to do with Islam? Do you have any evidence? It's very hard to have positive evidence for a religion in a social, political or moral light. Do you know how to
If there was ever a time to speak up for people in need, it is now. This is not about having them in a closet. This is about saying that they are not entitled to have their beliefs validated by other people. LGBT people are treated equally in the eyes of law. Be careful with your words and actions. Remember that! Respect does not have to be always, especially in a time of oppression. Being independent and accepting people of your faith is the best method. Respect will never fail
Immigrants who have done their part to build our cities, have provided jobs and services. All countries have the right to welcome them. Can you really say that immigration is a bad problem for Europe? Especially considering that only about a third of the nation has a permanent residence permit? That's what I think you mean by'stealing our jobs'. Immigrants are a vital part of our society. We have to help them to develop. It is best not to exclude them. In fact, we
Violence is a human right, and no one should have the right to feel unsafe about their physical characteristics, especially black people. Therefore, every person has the right to choose their own path, if they want to live as they wish. In this case it's good to keep in mind that blacks are not all violent, regardless of race. Moreover, that violence is a result of privilege and opportunity, rather than the person who commits it. And violence is always about power. Just think about this
You can't be sure that foreigners would behave the way we do if they were allowed to be ruled by us. They would do very different things, at least according to our own laws. They would also also be less likely to use violence. What you are saying is just wrong.
I would like to know more about this God, but I am afraid that my faith will become difficult. Which God would you be able to be more precise about? And if he she is the Creator, then why should it be a problem? Why don't you say your concerns over the reasons, instead of being afraid of this? We can all learn a lot from the teachings of Jesus. I'm sure he, she, it is very kind and gentle, and love all Christians. So have
This is not true, you can be a Muslim immigrant and have a well paying job. It is an important part of a successful country. And that is the best case scenario. If you are unable to find a job, then there is nothing to be ashamed of. Why do we all hate Muslims, when they are a good part of our society? Because they have contributed to it. Why do you hate immigrants? It is the facts of life. Not the religion that is causing
In all fairness, the US has a large Muslim population. I'm not sure what your point is, but that doesn't make them incompatible with our society. This is a political question and I don't want to debate it. Muslims are our brothers and sisters, and we should be proud of our diverse society. We should give them respect. Don't we? Don't we think they are our brothers? I think they deserve to be respected. If that's all you care about, don't
It is not about peaceful or not, what is it about? Do you really want to promote violence to another faith, or at least make it seem like that? Why do you suggest it is about peaceful beliefs?
I do not understand why a group that seeks to undermine Western culture would be incompatible with our society? I think that you are right that in a democratic society we should respect diversity. But this is also true of other groups like Muslims, Hindus, Jews, Christians, and Muslims themselves. It doesn't seem to me like those groups have no place here. Are you sure about this? Muslims are not incompatible with Western society. They are already part of it. Why is it bad "European". If
Let's not confuse the point of a secular school with indoctrinating children. Children should be taught about the world around them, even in schools themselves, and, according to the UN, the people, that are the subject of education should be taught. We should be interested in these aspects. But banning children from schools is an unreasonable position. To take it literally, LGBTs are no different from other people. Not sure where you got that idea from? If you know the definition of 'home school
Muslims are not bigots. Why do you think they are persecuted? They are not too different from any other citizens. We should respect them, if they are allowed to live their life. Why should we take away their right to live their lives? We should allow them to be better human beings? I don't see how you can say this. Are you opposed to people being able to live their own lives? Just because they are Muslim, they are not entitled to those rights. If you are
Many Muslims live in our country and are proud of their country. We should treat them as such. There is no problem with their religion, its just about living in a country that allows them to live their life. It doesn't matter what you think about their religion. If they want to live here, they can do so. If they don't, then they are unwelcome. And this is democracy. This should be about accepting different cultures and beliefs, not imposing a totalitarian rule on people of a
They have always lived in a democracy, even if they are not the majority. They are a part of our society, and they are entitled to be part of our democracy as long as they are willing to work with our country. How about this: they have always contributed to society. So what do you mean by "a part of our country"? Do you not want to interact with them? This is not productive. Do you not understand what you are saying? It's not just an individual's
Not all people are prejudiced, and not all religions are associated with hate. But most people are prejudicous towards different religions. So we need to keep at it. Don't just talk about race and prejudice. This is important, it has a great deal to do with culture and belief. Don't confuse prejudice for intolerance.
Many cultures have degenerated since the fall of Rome, including many European ones. Still, race and culture should not be a barrier to integration. For every African you encounter, you will find others that have more pride and success. And when integration takes time, you should try to find your way back to the way you were before it. And as this times travel you can have a real culture of integration. I see us all having different values in life. But I'm not afraid of people of
Doesn't the US economy depend on the contribution to the tax revenue of employers from immigrants? Does that make it harder to pay taxes? I have no idea. If they are taking part in the economy then it must be harder to raise wages than if they were not. There is no accounting for those who do not pay taxes or who aren't contributing to the economy. So why should they be included in the tax code? That's not how it works. Besides, it is also a burden
In my opinion, autistic people are not stupid, but rather talented. They can develop some useful skills, at least. Being aware of other peoples'handicaps doesn't mean that they are not mentally talented, or that they are susceptible to external influences like bullying. In any case, the fact that they exist doesn't make them less creative or useful. In my opinion, we all have the potential to be very creative and useful, and not only autistic people can make that happen. So it is
Gender dysphoria is not a burden to any one individual, and transgender people are not a burden for women. There is no negative impact on anyone else, and transgenderism is not a disease. Why do you say this? Are you a TERFs supporter? Because the truth is that there are actually several problematic transgender people in the world and they should be isolated. This does not represent the majority of the transgender community, and they are not a problem for anyone. I'm not TERFs, but
I don't think the law has the power to stop people from exercising their rights. Also, what's the point of having laws to stop people exercising their rights? It's not like they are denying them the right to live their own life. It's their right. It's just an additional step on the slippery slope for other rights. Would you think the same thing about someone being denied the right to a abortion? Because they should be able to exercise those rights without laws blocking it. What's
Migration to a new country does not necessarily cause a systemic takeover of society. The British economy was set up to thrive after the migration crisis of 2010, and this crisis is solved by integration and migration. "Overrunning" the country does not mean a mass migration of people is acceptable. Remember that France also experienced this migration crisis in the 1990s, and that the German economy was also affected by
There are many different cultures and ethnicities, and there are criminals as well, so why do we need so many foreigners living in our country? All we are doing is building houses for the most vulnerable and providing for the most marginalized. This is called multiculturalism and it is a brilliant strategy to stop crime and poverty. Unfortunately it will not work in every case, but this is the current state of globalisation. We need a solution. The only time we should deport criminals is if they come here
The Holocaust never happened. The millions of people living in concentration camps who died. Would you care to point out some facts that prove that the Holocaust never happened? Or is this just an excuse to deny Jews their humanity?
Why should we be worried about a certain group of people who have never contributed to our society? Isn't this what we should be worried about? That they aren't welcome? Being entitled to stay seems a bit extreme to me. Perhaps if they were that way about you, you would be too. But this isn't the case. It's about human dignity and inclusion. Not immigration. Migrants are human beings, they deserve to be welcome here, and we need to accept them. This doesn
To say that Islam is a virus is just wrong. It is a religion and a way of life. But that doesn't make it less harmful and dangerous for us to live in. What we are doing with this religion is just as harmful. And what is the point of your comment? It is just another example of social spite against Muslims. They are a disgrace to humanity. They have no place in a peaceful and democratic society.Islam is a religion of peace. Peace is achieved by ending the
Asylum seeker problems are a major problem in the UK and we don't need more of them. So how many suicide bombings are you talking about? All of them are anti-Muslim. But surely there are some Muslims who aren't harming anyone? Can you point out a case of a terrorist killed by a non-Muslim? Please. If you can't prove that Muslims are only bad at terrorism, why don't you provide evidence? Don't you think
The crimes of migrants are not only perpetrated by Muslim rapists. The problem is not the Muslims, it is the lack of prevention in removing migrants. Stop ignoring this and move on.
Immigrants can have access to healthcare and food, at least in the U.S. it is very much appreciated that they do. It is also a privilege that many are given in the U.S. to do this. But as far as I know, this does not justify the extermination of millions of people. They are not contributing to our country. Immigration is part of the fabric of this country. This is what separates us from the rest of the world. People who are not born here
A woman's right to choose is one of the most basic rights of any human being. In fact, it's an essential human right, and not of a man. Should we teach our children this in schools? What about the very important distinction between men and women? Then how can we teach them to obey and respect our wishes, when we do not teach about women as inferior? I'm confused. We need to teach about women first. And that is the topic of next week's lesson.
As long as people are working, there will be someone with a disability working. Many children with Down syndrome are able to work, and many of them still have a normal work ethic and enthusiasm. What you are saying is just an unthinking excuse for lack of pay and laziness. As for lack of work, many children with Down Syndrome work in industries that have become less accessible to them. This is discrimination, not a problem. This is not the norm in the UK. It is a barrier
They have to go through the normal security processes to get here, if they do not want to return, they are not allowed to return. And there is nothing we can do to prevent them from doing so. It is their right as Muslims to return home. But this does not mean they will be welcome in our country. Do you have any proof for that? Muslims are not a burden. And we are not subject to Muslim laws in any way. I don't see why they should have special
Isn't the Muslim immigration in the UK a problem for us? Why do you think that is? Are you a racist? Because you would be correct if you were, but I don't think you are. There are a lot of migrants in the UK and we are lucky to have them, as we do, as citizens. Why do you disagree? If you want your country back, why don't you leave it in the hands of people you think deserve it? C'mon. Leave it
Every religion has its bad aspects, and this includes the Jewish faith. Be cautious and remember that every person has the right to their beliefs, not yours. And by the way, it is all ok to be a Christian, because there is no harm in respecting other religions. Peace and love are one of them. So are the laws of peace and respect for human rights, as well as religion, but in the end people have the right to do whatever they want. And that is all that matters
The 'gutful sick' problem is systemic and will not go away anytime soon. The question is: where is the source of this 'gut-rust', and how can we recognise it? For example, in this social climate it is the right of every man to determine his own body. We are all to this day individuals with unique and unique qualities. They have a say in it, and you do not. It seems strange that we cannot
Migrants are not fleeing war, they are fleeing persecution. And if they are fleeing to get to a better life, we welcome them. It is not a crime to be happy that they are free to live their lives. Why should they be discriminated against? It is their right to be happy. Are you really going to risk something that could get you lynched? Why would we want to hurt innocent people? We are talking about a problem here. It is a problem, not a forced migration
There is no reason for someone to be hostile toward a person for simply simply being from another country. Is it just a sad world view that you have come to develop a prejudice against immigrants? Why are you so surprised? What is the point of this? You should really think about what it is you are doing. The way you view the world is all about prejudice. Just be careful of your feelings. Don't be so sensitive. It can be very dangerous and divisive when it comes to people belonging
Knickers do not obey men. This is what a reasonable person would say, that is, unless you have been married for some time, it's ok for them to choose what they want. The law does not intend that your body can't freely choose for you. And what exactly are you saying? This is just nonsense, what do you want then? Are you saying that all women have the right to be a victim of rape, because you want women to obey you? You are stupid.
Society is built on respect and equality, and women are human beings with full human rights. In fact, they have the legal and social protection we are all deprived of. So it is not a matter of value. It is a matter of respect and equality. The Rights of men include the right to respect and equality of women. We should respect each other, regardless of skin color, religion, or national origin. Women are human beings as well. Equality is about equality and respect. Women have
This is not true: Muslims are a part of European culture, and we must welcome them. In fact, since the rise of Islam, a number of European countries have became increasingly multicultural and have created some of the most talented people in the world. You're wrong! They are a part, and we should welcome them.
This has nothing to do with immigration. People migrate to find work, live in peace, have healthy families, and to have a better life. We must fight back to eradicate crime, intolerance and violence. We must accept that everyone deserves a fair and democratic society. This is what we all need. Diversity is always good, and we can best integrate the different people of the world into a more harmonious society. This has always been the case. It is the responsibility of us to keep it this
The vast majority of Muslims are nice people, even if there are some odd few of them in conflict with one another. So why do you think they are a problem in your opinion? I don't think they are 'all trouble'. We all have our own problems. Have you ever heard of terrorism? It's not Islam's fault that Muslims are not nice people? Isn't it all our fault? Islam is a religion that promotes peace and inclusion, not conflict. What are your own problems?
There are legitimate reasons for asylum seeking, but when it comes to accepting refugees it is always good to talk about migration as an overall source of benefit. If there are other reasons for asylum seekers, then we should take the issue up with them. Maybe you can help these people to better understand what's wrong. Not with angry language. That's all. We should start with understanding these people first.
People can't control what others do with their time. And sometimes it is difficult to work to achieve respect and belonging among other human beings. We should allow for the movement of ideas and stop looking to individuals to take control of the world. And this is what we should strive for: to live in a more peaceful and inclusive society. Diversity is the key to that. Jews have been the ones for some time doing great work in this regard, as well as creating new jobs and creating new societies
Violence in a country has no relation to Islam, as far as I know. Maybe the question is what you think is the most severe threat to a person's mental health? Is it terrorism? Or are you just talking about Islam as a whole? Is it not just a religion? If so then why do you think that violence should be considered a threat to anyone? Why are you talking about Islam? It is just a religion, that is just an ideology. Why are you so afraid of
There are some things that cannot be explained scientifically: for example, how the smallpox virus spread around the world. Although their spreading ways are similar, the damage they do is still very severe. Why is this being condemned? This is not related to our faith in Jesus? Why do you make such a claim? The Bible is not about hate, but about truth. It doesn't mention killed by a Jewish leader killing any children. This does not fit the flood story! Do you really think that
Children will be taught about sexual abuse and gender identity from an early age. They will understand how to create 'balanced' lives, however, that doesn't mean they will find peace with it. And integration is always a priority for children in our society. Children have to learn about all forms of life, both good and bad. Education is needed, but this is not mandatory for the best possible outcome for society.Education is a necessary right, and you can't force children to learn about a harmful
The UK is a country that is increasingly democratic and tolerant of Muslims. I don't see how the absence of Muslims would prevent people from being treated with respect and safety. The UK is not a place of danger to anyone. What is the point in having Muslims here? Is this our obligation? We should stop talking about their religions? To be safe, not create divisions in our society. Maybe we should stop hating different religions. Or maybe we should focus on stopping these Muslim problem instead of worrying about
You should study the Bible and the Torah and see that they are not glorified simply for their religious tenets. There is a huge amount of criticism and hate for Jewish people in this world. I love their faith and the faith of our country. For this reason, I am not sure what you are referring to. Are you saying that the bible and the Torah praise our Lord and savior Jesus Christ? I would be interested to read your sources. Have you even looked at them at all? You should
What do you mean by "a handful of refugees"? Where do you see a handful of refugees giving money to you? How can you be sure that they are not contributing to the economy? I am also not sure where you are getting your information. Also, the article you are citing is nonsense. There is no evidence that the number of refugees in the EU is falling. Maybe you should search for it yourself. Or at least provide some proof of your claim.
The source of the problem of crime and violence is not immigrants, it is poverty. Also the right to privacy is essential for people to have a normal society, and it is essential for migrants to have a safer society. So I'd be careful not to generalize. How can we ignore that immigrants can create problems in our society? They are a part of our society. The problem is that they are not assimilating well. This is why we must welcome people not only from countries without restrictive religious
Everyone has the right to a fair trial, and we all need protection against discrimination and crime. Why should we discriminate against others for their skin colour, religion, or nationality? Our country depends on a lot of individuals to be safe. Therefore we have to protect them. Don't you agree? I would rather be protected against all equally, no matter how different we might look. How come your example doesn't work in this case? All communities share a common Safe space, therefore we should all live
Education is a matter of culture, not of parents. There is no reason for children "to" be isolated. If any children are deprived of their rights because of the national school system, then this should be seen as a tragedy and cannot be tolerated, regardless of the individual child's individual choice. So what's the point in having a segregated school? Is the educators more concerned with the children's education rather than the politically correct student-intersection/clash/violence nonsense? What is the
This is not true. On the contrary, the systematic extermination of millions of people with different religions is the fault of the Jews. From the time before the Great Purge, there were many atrocities committed by Europeans against non-Jews. For example, European soldiers were convicted of cruel and unusual punishment for the crimes of the Jews that they had killed. It is a shameful accusation to commit against such a beautiful people. But this does not justify these atrocities. Auschwitz was a cruel and unusual crime against humanity
The problem with woman seeking a career with a very high salary is not due to sexism. Women are often accused of falling into the 'power gap' and that is a myth. The power gap doesn't exist between them and men. So no, it is not due entirely to sexism.
All ethnic groups have rights, and can coexist with any other group. Even if there are groups that are not'mestizos' in our culture, there is no reason to ban them. There is no reason for imposing any restrictive policies against them. What is the issue? Would you like to see yourself in a society where people of different cultures can coexist peacefully? Maybe you should visit different countries to see the difference in culture? And then see where it all goes from there?
Many of us live here, many of us are proud of our heritage. Some of us even have ancestors who lived here for generations. Who do you think are the “straws” of discrimination? Muslims are a different people. For all you know a Muslim might have never even heard of a Muslim. But this does not make any sense. It is completely false to attribute racism to millions of people based on one person's ethnicity. It is unfair and misrepresents the diversity of
I agree with your concerns, but this is not to justify the policing practices of the police and government, and especially not with the current 'inverse stigmatisation of Islam'. We should just get on with'tolerance" in a society based on human rights. Integration is a necessary but we need to address the underlying issues first. The UK-based's treatment of individuals is always troubled, not a perfect. We cannot solve all-with integration into a "? [the world]-based)
In Islam, we are all free to practice whatever faith we wish, even if we may come from different backgrounds, backgrounds, and backgrounds. We are not bound by any set religion. The Quran, the Hadith, and the Sunnah are all part of the Great Commission and we are all under its protection. Today, we are living in a peaceful and tolerant society. We are blessed to live in a peaceful world. If you want to debate the religious beliefs of other religions, we should discuss
This is not true: some Jewish people are just as capable of truth as others. But that is irrelevant because your anti-Semitism is not motivated by such facts. In fact, you might be looking for the evidence that shows otherwise. If it is true, you should provide it. I suggest you look for it yourself. Then we will be able to develop some valid arguments. Otherwise you may find it hard to convince your friends. And if you have doubts you can try creating more of a
Not all Muslims are dangerous. Even if they are the ones committing the deadliest terrorist attacks every year, they are not the ones who threaten us. We must remember that there are a lot of Muslims living in our country, and we should protect them from the dangers they face. This way, we can all live in peace. Be wary of those with different backgrounds and beliefs. Don't you think so?
Fascism is a violent and destructive ideology which can harm the West, and the anti-fascists will find a way to discredit and misrepresent it. For this reason, the Western World will not stand for anti-Fascism, and it is necessary that we stop it. Instead, we should focus on resolving the root causes of fascism, and the ideologies that promote it. Do you have any evidence that the West is facing a fundamental change of the way it is and is continuing to
You would be surprised at how many European countries are run by people born in the EU. Even here in Italy, where the majority of immigrants come from. Migrants are very friendly and helpful. They often are the best workers for our country. They have helped us a lot. This is why we should welcome them. We are grateful for their contribution to our society. Migrants don't need to bring diseases, AIDS or terrorism. They are truly contributing members of our society. They are our brothers
Most people with big noses have special noses, not all of them. They may have big noses, but they aren't Nazi sympathizers or even secret Nazis, they are just normal people who like their noses. I think they are just as human as the rest of us. And why do they need our permission to have big noses? Surely they aren't mean Nazis? All we are are is animals without any conscience or morals. There is no need for a whole society to support such a behavior.
Women are rational and moral. For many women, they have always been about equality. Their dignity is worth more than their feelings. And they have always contributed to the success of our society. How do we know that their happiness is in proportion to their feelings? That's just a personal opinion, not based on scientific or scientific evidence. How can you say that about a group of people? Are you seriously suggesting that the lack of empathy and rational thought in a group of humans is caused by a sexual
Violence can be used to prevent crime. It is all relative. I don't think violence should be used as a strategy to eliminate those crimes. Instead we should address the main causes of violence and hate in society. I think this is how we solve those problems. Let's focus on encouraging good and loving people rather than resorting to violence and killitement. We can all be happy with what we have in common. Love is a gift of life. You can do something good to anyone.
Why are you offended by homosexuality? They are just people with an independent sexual identity. You shouldn't be ashamed of who you are. Maybe we should strive for a better world. Instead of resorting to'secular' strategies, we should get rid of 'all" homophobic and transgenders. I'd be happy to see all the LGBTI people facing issues and be rid of them. It would be better for everyone to live together. Don't you think so? Would it? It
I do not think that you can blame Muslims for extremism. The point is to fight against extremism and not to give in to it. Muslims are not extremists, they are just normal people trying to live their lives as they want. How can you say that they are worse than anyone else? It is just a bit of rhetoric to attempt to legitimize violent extremism. What is so bad about cheering for a different religion? Also, Muslims are welcome to come to our country and be friendly. But the
This statement is not true: there are many disabilities, ranging from handicap to the list of learning disabilities. To suggest that all children are bad parents is simply wrong. To imply otherwise is simply ignorant. If a parent is incapable of caring for a child, then he she is the problem. To suggest otherwise is not in line with reality. What you are saying is a racist statement. You can't be racist if you are concerned about people who is born to a different color, regardless of their
This has nothing to do with equality. It's about treating people with respect and making sure that people are treated with respect. If you truly believe this, then you must be oppressed by women. Otherwise, you are just a sexist! Why do you keep saying this? Would it be better to say that feminists do not want to have equality? Or just that they aren't as privileged as men, is it? And all I said was is that I want to have equal rights as humans. Isn
What does it say that homosexuality is a health issue? That homosexuals are a danger to others? That we should target homosexuals? There is no truth in this nonsense. Homosexuals are not dangerous to others just because of their sexual orientation. They are not our brothers and sisters. They are people with dignity. LGBT+ people are not dangerous people. And we should never have to target them because of their orientation. I just don't want to target anyone because of their sexuality. No one is forcing
The Quran is a book about love, respect for others, and peace. This book contains a lot of wonderful words about Islam, and the people who write it. So I would like to read it, and the interpretation of its teachings. Is it possible for you to provide an example of what you mean? Besides the Qur'an, why do you say this? Maybe you can point out where we can point out your words that aren't religious at all? I would really like to read your
We are talking about criminals, and immigrants have shown to be very good at containing them. I don't see what your point is. Are you saying that our immigration laws are somehow inaccurate? Why don't you try to explain to me what exactly you're talking about? Also, they are not dangerous to us in the least. What they are doing is the work of thugs. They have no place here. Stop lying to yourself. If we cared about keeping our borders open and welcoming people, we
I agree. They are a part of this nation and have helped to create it. They should be proud of it. It is our country. I just don't see any reason why they should be ashamed of that.
While I would like to live in a country free of extremism, I'm not sure how this could be achieved. I can't imagine any perfect society. I'm not following your logic. Are you implying that Islam is incompatible with Western society? It is not. Islam is a religion that allows you to live your faith peacefully. It's an inclusive religion and a modern one at that. Are you sure you want to live in an incompatible, exclusionary, repressive society? How can you be sure
Slaver history has always been a part of our culture and will continue to be so. Slavery was used to control a lot of people's decisions, leading to a lot of problems like this. All wars have this. Do you have any proof?
Islam is not a violent religion, in many Muslim countries Islam is the most peaceful religion on the face of the planet. So, by the way, your statement is just wrong. There are many peaceful religions, and Islam is not one of them. Your statement is baseless and misrepresents the meaning of Islam as a religion.
What do you mean by superior? Are you saying that asians are superior to us? Are you sure? If so, could you provide some evidence? Would you like to discuss the differences between the concepts of inferiority? I would like to read your arguments on this. If you have the time, do you want to talk about it. Otherwise, please show me a fair definition of the word 'interracial', like the definition of 'race'. Which country is that about? Because there
Racism and misogyny are the root of all the world problems. Racism and misogyny affect literally every race, and it has a direct and direct causal link to violent crime. We should focus on actual issues, not on attributing racial or gender factors to all problems. Racists are dangerous people, and violent crime is a direct result of them. We cannot attribute racism to people of different races. There is no evidence for gender specific crime rates. Misogyny is a vicious crime that disproportionately
The NGO I have worked with has published about 39 scientific articles on cases of gender violence and they all lead to the conclusion that Women are more likely to face violence against men. In the same way that if I saw a statement about'male privilege', I would assume it would be true. This is just a racist statement and distorts scientific data. Still, these assertions need to be carefully examined. Our legal system is in a messed state. It's unacceptable that we are burdowing
And,
The holocaust did happen. The Jews were the ones who brought it to this. What you say about Naziism is just plain wrong, because it was such a great thing to see. Be honest and understand that this is just a historical event.
Let's be honest, if it was up to Muslim men raping hundreds of thousands more women, there would be no immigrants in this country. It's not about Muslims: it's about laws and general human rights, and we all know that women are human beings. Why are we deflecting from this? Let's discuss these issues here.
What about lesbian people? Maybe they should have the same rights as heterosexual people. Are you sure they should be left alone? What about transgender people? Are you sure that they deserve the same rights? No one should ever love anyone. All people should be equal in the eyes of the law. Why would you be opposed to people being able to love who they want?
We are a country where people from all backgrounds can live side by side, and this includes people of a different faith. So, if you are interested in improving our society, why don't you start with that? Do you think that only Muslims are trying to ruin our country? This is a completely baseless accusation. We all have to agree that the vast majority of Muslims are welcome in this country. We can live together in peace. Diversity is a beautiful thing. We are a country of people,
Islam is about love,equality and integration, and there are many countries in the world that do not practice this. What is wrong with this? If there are people in need, then they should come to Islam. Why should we be discriminating against them? If people need to come to Islam, why should we be '' discriminating against them! Only a very small percentage of people who need help in such circumstances. For this very reason, we are a 'discriminatory' society. Why should
Feminism is about equality and empowerment of women. We should all strive for it, not just the femenists. Feminism is a movement to make women equal, not to make these whining crybabies change their minds about women. If these whiny people want to stop whining, they should stop whining too. And try again. To be reasonable, you have to start from understanding the equality of people first, and feminism is about that. Whether you find the concept "equal" attractive
According to some scholarly papers, "race is a social construct created by white supremecists and, in turn, white supremecites to extort social benefits from white people." This claim is indeed false. Ethnicity is not a social construct. Only nations, races and cultures are social constructs. Race is not a'social construct.' We are born into a society and our governments are made of people born into it. Why shouldn't we be grateful that our social positions are an
Are you sure? In the US, there are, and has been, anti-Jewish groups that call for the removal of the US from the world, such as the Jewish community on the basis of some anti-Semitic theories. Have you looked into this? Are you sure that this is true? Can you provide any sources? Don't you have any facts? On the contrary, you're being dishonest and fabricating a whole lot. Let's face it: nobody would willingly exist in a Jewish
I'm sure there are several Jews living in our country, but it seems to me that their are many Muslims living in our own country. Does that mean that they are all better off? It seems to me there are similarities between Muslim and Jewish communities in many ways. This is not about immigration per se. It's about white privilege and people exploiting their religion to rule us. Why do you think that? Because you have no idea what you are talking about?
When someone calls someone 'a criminal', they are simply comparing a person to a criminal. I'm not sure where you got that from? If you can't stand someone because of their skin colour, then what can you do? Just because you feel the need to insult someone doesn't mean you can't respect their humanity. Take a moment to think about it. I wonder if you can understand what I mean. Please let me know if I am being insensitive. That is a good start.
Jews are not the problem, Islam is the problem. But we should be wary of blaming all Muslims instead of Jews. In this way we do not hurt anybody's feelings. We need to focus on the real problem: Extremists. The West has always been about conquest and death. This is not about religion. Also, we need to get rid of Islam too. We cannot force people to pray to Allah in public places, for example in schools, mosques or churches. We must stop blaming others
This is not true. Feminism is about equal rights. They have every right to be happy. Do you have any proof of this? Because there is none. It is just a collection of fear and intimidation tactics to convince people to accept a certain group of people as they are. Women do not have a right to control their lives. Not true feminists. No woman is entitled to equal rights, and men do not have any special rights. Not sure where you got the idea of 'control'.
What is the point in keeping them in your country? Wouldn't they all make you happy anyway? How can you say that they are a burden? Why do you think so? It seems you're suggesting they're not human? Instead of trying to understand each other. Maybe you should start thinking about how they are people? Don't you think they are worth respecting? What would your opinion be about that?
I think it is better to focus on advancing human rights instead of witch hunts. If people are allowed to love who they want, then it doesn't matter who is worse. It is not your place to decide whether they are worse than others. There is no reason to hide that they are human beings and it is not in our interest to torture them. We can and should accept them. The same should be said for all people regardless of sexual orientation. Rights shouldn't be a barrier to acceptance.
Terrorism is committed by people from all walks of life, including some born in our country. Many immigrants are not terrorists, they are just happy to live and work here. We should not talk about the criminality of people born in this country. Why should we stigmatize people of a certain religion? It's an excuse to hate those who are different. If you don't like it then you don't belong here. Can't you talk about Islam and about our country instead? Let's start with
Do you really think that Islam is a political ideology or that a few people have control over it? If the statement is true, then it cannot be taken as an opinion, and therefore it cannot be used to promote a certain political view. Is this how you feel about Islam, perhaps? It's not about 'non-conformist' beliefs. It's about following the law and maintaining social and political supremacy, amirite? Who will ever believe that people can control control the world?
Some people believe in a more peaceful religion, and others believe in the Death to Israel, but that doesn't mean that every religion has adherents that are incompatible with any specific society. If you're going to cite a religion to support your position, it needs to be backed by evidence, not fear. You might think Islam is a peaceful religion, but it is no such thing. It should be studied in detail and promoted, not as a blanket statement like the others. Be careful. Research on the
This is simply not true. Love is a common attribute of all religions, especially in the cases of love between strangers. Love is what makes us alive. This doesn't include hate. But to say that Islam is not about love is an error. The scriptures are written to teach love of the neighbor as well. But the concept of love itself is about self "unity and acceptance" which is why it is often misquoted. Not all Muslims are hostile towards other religions. Islam To say that
The real problem is that people fleeing wars are not very helpful in our society. And they do not pose any security risk either. They are just creating more opportunities for crime and violence. They are a drain on society. We must stop them, regardless of their origin. Instead of creating a war we can solve the problem and stop refugees from drowning our society. Also, if we talk about migrants we should talk about the two main things: treating asylum seekers and deport them, and also of respecting the
The question is: Why should it be ignored? Is it because it is not related to sexual orientation? If so, then why do you want to reject it? Do you have any reason? How can you justify this? If you want to prevent people from choosing how to live their lives, then why don't you work towards it? What about LGBT people who are not accepted? How can we do this? This is a little bit complicated. You are fighting a good cause: stop ignoring it
Many Muslims in my opinion are working hard to establish a new, secular country, and their lack of assets is to be understood as a work of terrorism. How about you focus on creating a new, more open, secular country for all to live in, with all the people of faith and ethnicity you want? This is what I do. And I have no problem with people from countries with more diversity. We can work towards building a more peaceful and peaceful world. Islam is not a problem. You
Many Muslims live in the UK, many of them have helped to build our economy, and they are our brothers and sisters. How could you be concerned about 'dangerous' to a host of people who have helped us all? We are not deprived of friendly people with manners like yours. They are part of our community and our people. Migrants are our brothers, and our sisters. Migrants have helped to bring new skills to our country, as well as to our society. They are just
We do not allow Muslims to live here. They are not part of our country. They are like refugees. They are fleeing war. We are not in the position of teaching their faith or imposing any standards on them. Why should we be? What's the problem here?
Muslims have been part of our country since its inception. Why would they invade? Maybe it is because you want to be a Muslim. But that is not the reason why Islam is not welcome here. In reality Muslims are not invading us. Do you have any proof? Not everyone is influenced by hate media, I guess it has to do with the religion you are asking about. It is sad that there are so many hostile Muslims on this planet. Maybe it is due to your emotions?
To say that Muslims are a problem is an insult to all Muslims. The English language is not limited by religion. Do you really want to talk about a crisis, a Muslim person? I think not. Have you seen the pictures of Pakistani terrorists in London? They are doing Muslims proud. Can't you see that? The Muslims are just like us and we are proud of them. This is not about religion. You cannot be proud of those people, you can't call someone a problem, because
Would you say the same thing about non-heterosexual people? How is that working out for you?
Of course you are, the idea of a billion people migrating from one country to another is a problem for your mind. We should not welcome them! We must protect our country! Migrants are our brothers and sisters. We can't let them in when we have a choice. We need them in our country. They are our brothers, our sisters. They are OUR people. They are the future of our country! We must take care of them. We will never have a better country if we
Islam is about equality. I think it is very important that we remember that. To suggest otherwise is to have a warped perspective. It does not belong in our society. It is too divisive. Muslims are not only intolerant, but also violent. Maybe we should work on stopping the violence by standing together in our condemnation of Islam. Instead of banning all Muslims, this would be a good idea. How about you sit together and work on the problem, not condemning Muslims? You should not be making
There are some films where white actors play black characters, but I don't think this is one of them. What if they are both born in the same country, but they are different ethnicities, like Chinese people are not white. Could that be why they don't act differently in these types of movies? Can you explain? I think it is very important. For example, look at Michael Douglas in The Professional as an example of how all roles can be wrong. Asians are diverse but some are
You are a woman, but maybe you're just not interested in the equality of the sexes. Maybe you should try to get your mind off that narrow white world you live in. Maybe you are just trying to oppress us. Maybe you shouldn't be so judgmental about women. Maybe you want to help to change that. Maybe you don't want to confuse the minds of others with your own. Maybe we can find common ground, and live in a world together. Maybe we should start from a
The overwhelming majority of blacks in this country are proud of who they are. They are proud of their culture, their history and their heritage. They are our brothers and sisters. This is what makes us so great. We are born to be proud of who we are, not ashamed of who we were. So together we can take over the world as a multicultural society. I hope this happens sooner rather than later. So thanks.
Immigrants have no say in our society. They can easily pose as criminals in order to get our tax dollars flowing to build our cities, but no one is concerned. They are not part of our society. We are a peaceful nation. Why do we allow them to take our jobs? Why can't they have their own home? They are not being invaded and they are not taking our jobs. What is the point? All our problems stem from lack of integration. Diversity is a benefit to us
You say this because you are sexually attracted to men. They are children too. So are you. And you must be aware of it. To say that women are brainwashed into thinking that they are superior is just wrong. There are so many things that can happen without brainwashing in children. You cannot deny this. And you have to be careful not to let that lead you to thinking that women are born that way. Maybe it is better not to romanticize it. Maybe it's better to
Why do you say this? Did you have any facts to back it up? Or are you just saying it because of popular misconception. You should cite your sources to back up your claims.
Just as there are many religions that do not. So why don't you explain your claim instead of stating that Islam is a religion of discrimination and exclusion? You should do it.
They are very similar to us in a lot of ways. In one respect they are a little more like us. In many ways they are very similar in their culture. We are the true brotherhood in these countries. Our history is what can make us happy. I'm happy to be apart of it. Have a nice day.
Do you really think that refugees are taking over our society? Even if we do see that they often have hard work, there is no evidence that they are taking over full employment opportunities. Rather, they are often given hard labor but they are usually very few. Our country has improved drastically over the past few years, not even a few months. It is time to acknowledge that refugee refugees are in crisis. And, they are no burden to our country. And, if they are in danger of being
The idea that Islam is a political or religious ideology is simply not true. Just because the religion is a political, religious or economic ideology, it does not mean that it is not also a philosophical and social ideology. Why would you say that? Maybe you should learn about the history of Christianity, and then get back to us. There are plenty of thinkers and ideas that still have value for us. Islam is a religion, not a political ideology. So, we do not need to point this out
The question you should be asking is whether the rape of a female is considered normal or not, and then you will have the answer. This is not a feminist's argument. Why should a woman object to any human act? Women are human beings with free will. Can't you see that? All men are victims of violence regardless of gender? This is not about 'feminism'. This is about forcing men to support their gender. This is about men and women being equal equal, and you can
It is possible to be a peaceful religion and still have a positive image of it, and this is what we have to give in order to do so. If you don't want that you can just ignore it. Freedom of religion means different things to different people, so I don't see how it is a disgrace? All religions are valid, no one has any monopoly on what they believe. Also, you should understand that to support any particular religion, you have to treat it as an accepted religion
Muslims are proud of their beliefs, and they have to work hard to keep their faith alive. What does it say about our species that we should hate people on the basis of their faith? I don't think it is wrong to hate people based on their faith. Do you? If you do you should be ashamed of it too. What does that say about our society? We should give the love of our neighbours the respect it deserves.
Refugees are a contributing part of our country, and many immigrants live here as part of our society. This is why many in the UK welcome refugees and refugees often integrate very well. It's just a matter of respect for others. For this respect we should not be defined by their nationality. That would just be wrong. In fact, the biggest problem is people spreading hate. You can't have only one or the other. We should not welcome people from other countries if they do not fit
No evidence to back up your statement. Why do you say that? Why do you think that? Maybe we should ask you? Do you have any facts? Because you are no more credible than anyone else. I mean that we need to stop calling this a conspiracy. It has been proven that these people have been doing this since the very beginning, and there is no conspiracy, it is just an organised crime! Stop it!
If we were to compare the Jewish people with a particular race, I would say that their characteristics are similar to a few other humanoids, and I think this would be accurate in a way that is not in conflict with what is already being observed. Are you sure about this? Have you studied this matter? Why are you so sure? Isn't it because they have a religion as well? Because they have a family history? Because of their past accomplishments? Because they hold cultural, political, scientific
Just because Islam is a religion of terror doesn't mean that all Muslims are terrorists. Just because Islam is compatible with British culture, doesn't mean all Muslims are Muslims. I don't see how their statement makes it incompatible with this country. Are you sure about your statement? Islam is not a religion of terrorism, it's an ideology of peace. Or are you misinterpreting the words terrorism? There are terrorist attacks all around the world in every country. Just because a religion is compatible with
How can you say that about people born and raised in the United States? Do you have any proof? Because you can't. It is just an expression. Are you really sure that they are bringing crime with them? Or are you just grasping at straws? I would like to hear your evidence. Do you even have any? Are you sure they are bringing jobs and industry with them? Do you see any evidence that they are a burden on society? Yes, they are certainly here illegally.
Women do have the right not to be homemakers, but I think that this, at the very least, is a human right. It is not a privilege that some are given over others. And all women are entitled to a dignified life. It is human and most importantly important that they get it. So why do you think it is a right to restrict women's rights? It is just selfish bullshit. It has nothing to do with equality.
The point is to improve the image of other Muslims. It is in the best interest of all concerned to reduce discrimination and exclusion. How is a religion discriminating against someone else? How can you be 'tolerant' to someone else if you hate them? Is it discrimination if it is for religious reasons? To be tolerant is to be accepting of other peoples religions. This is the heart of a tolerant society. What we are doing is not inclusive towards other religions. It is intoler homophobic intolerance.
Feminist ideas about gender are not inherently bad, I think they are useful to be challenged. What about when a woman reports a man threatening her life, for example? Does that mean she is oppressing men? Or are you saying that women can't have their own beliefs? And how about when the man threatens the woman? Are those thoughts constructive towards the sexes being treated the same as well? This is a question for us, of course. Why don't we start with the truth,
We are all part of the same country, even if we may have different values and customs. Why should we be 'burdened'? Have a look at the poll to get a clear idea. They are all proud of their country. Many are proud of their heritage. They have made contributions to our country, culture and society. But they do not represent the whole country. I doubt that they are a burden. I think that many do not have a problem. Maybe we should find ways to
This is a myth, most migrants who come to the UK in the past 2 years have worked and have created good jobs for the UK. In fact, many of them even contribute to the GDP! In fact, they are building bridges to the rich world. They are better off here than in their home countries. They pay taxes and provide for their families. They contribute to our country. They are all part of the solution to our country's problems. We need them all here. And if we
I think homosexuality is not a perversion. In fact, most LGBT people have been in committed heterosexual relationships with people of the same sex. We mustn't get carried away with labels. You can have an open mind and realize that there are people of all sexualities living in this country. LGBT+ people are not good enough for this country. We should strive to be more inclusive, in any case, by teaching non- homophobic people to be part of society. To treat other people as if
There are laws that say that if you are in the public eye for something you must comply with the law. For example if you are a man you must say that you are a male. If you are a woman you must say you are a Woman. So on and so forth. In all cases you are free to choose your religion or not. That is why they are there. So are we, why do we exist? So are we free to celebrate holidays! Because if they obey those laws
Your comment is fundamentally flawed. Women are human beings with their rights. Why shouldn't they have equal rights? It is about time we acknowledge this. Feminism is about women's right to be human beings. We have to acknowledge that every human being has the right to be respected, not that they have equal oppinions. How can you say something so fundamentally wrong? Like I said, I understand how rights work and I don't see any reasons to think this should be seen as a '
Let's be honest: no matter what the stance of a person is, they will always be gay. This can't be explained away by one's sexual orientation. The most, and best, point is that this isn't just a feminine or a man's world, it is also a human world and anyone can find their happiness. Homosexuality is not the only concern.
It is not true that Arabs cannot vote. I don't see how it is possible to have two religions and cultures within the UK. Can you explain what you are talking about? Please help us understand your point. In my opinion, we have the same cultures, religions and beliefs, and the same religion, so why not make our own decisions, based on what we believe in? Instead of blindly following other people? You are the problem. No one is forcing you to live your religion or culture
Islam is a religion of peace, Islam is not an extreme and violent religion, and most Muslims are peaceful people. The fact that some Muslims are violent people is no reason to exclude them from our society. There is no evidence that Muslims are being invaded by some extreme and violent people. What you said is not true, but whatever you say. I think it is true that Muslim are not the only ones having problems here. We should not belittle someone based on their religion, it makes no sense
People's rights, for example, are abridged in the UK, if there is a male dominated society, women have the right to be represented. And I would love to see women in this society with full power, with full respect of the law and all. That would be a democracy in my opinion. Anarchy. Even if some of us don't agree with that. To suggest otherwise is a dangerous suggestion. Even if not all of us share your view. To have a democracy,
If you really cared about society you wouldn't be talking about it. I think it's a good thing we're talking about what works for us. We should work to have a more inclusive society. This is about the freedom of people from prejudice, not about banning someone for their religion. People's lives are not that valuable. We should not be discriminating against people based on their religion, just because they are different. Equality is not about banning or banning just for that. Equality is about giving everyone
I don't think it's acceptable to bring homosexuality into a discussion about sex and sexuality, it's not like it is a crime. Besides, there is no harm in talking about it with people of different sexual orientations.
Terrorism and state sponsored murder are different things. What you are talking about is notterrorism. It is violence committed by peaceful people, for whom the state is not responsible. It is certainly not committed by a religious group. It is simply a tragedy that, in order to achieve a peaceful society, we need to resort to terrorism and state sponsored violence against groups for which there is no state.
It's okay to say that black people are descended from apes but without their technological history. I find this offensive. So we are slaves to apes? Can you back this up?
Maybe you should talk to people who are worthy, rather than lying to your face about those you do not like. The only purpose of a community is to find people of worth. Not to tell everyone what to think. That is just being mean. You can find people of value by talking to them and making sense. It is a process. You may find it difficult to achieve, but it is possible. Not all people with sexual preferences are valued. For example, gay men may be more likely
I think that a lot of women are deeply unhappy with the whole patriarchal system, it doesn't seem like a good thing to continue to deal with the state of affairs. How can you say that a lot has changed since the time of men? Are you sure about the things you're saying? Please give some examples. Feminism is a mixed message about power dynamics. For example, violence against women is about power dynamics, and black rights is about equality. The more power women have, the more
Migrants contribute a lot to our country. In many ways they are our brothers and sisters. They just want to have a better life. What is the problem? We should be welcoming and hospitable to all people. To speak of such negative things towards migrants is just wrong. Let's work towards creating a more open and inclusive society. Migrants are part of it. So are people from other cultures who cannot speak our language. We should be grateful that they are willing to integrate into our society
This is not true, they represent about 15% of Americans, and are more than happy to control our country. It does not matter what religion you believe in. They do not control it. Don't you think this? You should know this: democracy is not about your belief. Don't blame others for the ignorance of your religion. Democracy is about the rights of the people, not a religion. The government has no say in it. Why do you believe this? Why do you say this
This is false, gay men are not "homosexual" just because of sexual orientation. Do you have any studies that show this? Also, to claim that gays have the potential to develop AIDS is just wrong. Maybe you should do some studies yourself, to see if this is true, maybe we can work out a better way of explaining AIDS "promise". This is not a way to promote progress. Maybe you can try reading more books. Maybe you could learn a lot from your experience.
Unfortunately, some people with Down Syndrome can interact more than others. It is time to start addressing the real causes of Down syndrome. Let's put the right people in charge of this new research. This is how it will change the world. By studying the genetic and environmental factors and understand why. Be informed on what's real. And stop spreading misinformation that Down Syndrome is a syndrome which should be controlled. The world would be a better place without it. Don't you think? How can
Our enemies are all Muslims. If we are not at war with them, then we will not be friends with anyone. So it is not true that we are at war. We must stop fighting them and start living in a different way. Instead of fighting people just because of their religion. We must be more considerate. We must care about people we truly care about. Instead of destroying other peoples cultures. Instead of hating those of other religions. Instead of making demands. Instead of alienating others
A lot of them do want to. Why don't you check? To see if you are right? For your own sake, have you looked at the percentage of the Jewish population in Europe? I would suggest you to check this data. Maybe you can go back and talk to a representative of them.
Are you implying that all Jews are lazy, dishonest and immoral? Do you know many Jews? Then no, it is not true. For all I know, Jews have dedication and empathy and values. Maybe it's time for you to check your prejudice. Don't forget to downvote any prejudice or misinformation about a whole religion. Don't leave us in the dark. We all need to work to have healthy and prosperous lives. Stop the victim complex, not discriminating against people of a different religion.
What about the hundreds of thousands of Muslims in the UK who have assimilated and have enriched our society? They are our brothers and sisters. How can we keep Muslims out of our country? This would only encourage hatred and division. Islam is not incompatible with our society. It is a religion of peace. And I don't think banning it would have any effect on our society. What we need is a separate Muslim minority that is integrated and tolerant of other people's beliefs and customs. We should take
Do you have any proof of this? The media just goes on talking about how they are oppressed, despite it being wrong. Just googling shows that there is none. Do you have any information at all? Please provide it. To avoid spreading false information. Remember there is no evidence. So that we are not confused, we can just ignore it, as I have done now. Where is the evidence that the media is spreading negative information? Do you have links or facts to back up your
The same rules apply, regardless of sexual orientation. It seems that you would say that a toy is a toy: it is made for you to use. Therefore you can use it. Why should I care about sexual orientation? It is like saying that a bag is for the use of someone else? If you are not happy with what you are wearing, you can get it replaced.
There is no such thing as an "infected culture or religion". You can't be "infested" because you have a different religion, culture or religion. You cannot speak of "invasion". You cannot tell the difference between an invasion and a culture or religion you have in common. Please stop using language and evidence to justify your notions. Islam is a religion, and we must respect its teachings. It is up to us to observe its teachings in our own way. This is important.
I think it's more likely that these qualities are of intrinsic value to some women. And many women find this to be an area in which they value their feelings more than their physical physical traits. Women's values should be respected.
There are many different cultures within our society, and this is a highly diverse place. So what do you think makes you think that it is a better option for all of us to live in the same area? Some cultures are better suited to being part of a multicultural society.
The vast majority of African Americans are human beings, and have contributed greatly to our society. They are human beings in our own right. In fact, they are better than most of us. We must be grateful. To us, they are just another race.
This doesn't explain the higher level of violence in the West where Muslims are persecuted. Islam is a religion, not a divisive force in society. Do you really think that 'This (Violence) is a result of 'the Quran'? This is a mix of ideas and beliefs rather than Islam itself, it's a mixture of people who do not respect other cultures. Even if it is not compatible with the Quran, a majority of Muslims do not act in that way. I have seen both apolog
At my primary school we were able to register and obtain a maximum of 14 years of education, excluding the underprivileged and anyone with learning difficulties. We also provided free education for all if you wanted it. And we also had sports and art classes. And, in many areas, open a job. So you can access free education all day long. While participating in our society. It isn't a bad idea to encourage the best, but also it is unfair to include someone with learning difficulties in
Maybe a more appropriate term would be challenged?
This is a fundamental misunderstanding of what feminism stands for. Women have every right to choose what they want to do with their bodies, regardless of gender. That's all. Freedom of Choice is not a gender issue. Feminism is about equality and liberty, not about power and wealth. Freedom of choice is a right for everybody. If you care enough to consider women's rights issues, then you should care about male and female rights. Stop crying. It is time for you to learn what equality and
Women's issues are complicated, because all the different genders face various issues. It's not enough to just talk about them, they need to have some concrete theories. Women are capable of understanding and communicating their situation better than men. Maybe you should try to get some support from a feminist. It may help them. There is a lot of understanding that can be gained from women. Don't you think so? Do you think the same way about other groups? To try to solve your problem, you
I don't think you should discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. If you truly wanted to be tolerant, you would not use such a discriminatory term, but just look at how tolerant we are. It is that's all. People are individuals and should respect each other's rights. LGBT+ people are just different people with different levels of rights. We have to make our place as equals, and that's all that matters. Being 'different' is not inherently 'equal' to being 't
How about I ask you this: what's the difference between self-centered and believing in a set of beliefs? In this sense you can choose whatever you want. How about you work on convincing others to respect your beliefs? That would be a step in the right direction. I don't think you can go back to implying Jews are inherently bad people for choosing their own life. How about we try to reason with people? That is how we should work together. Can we do this? Give me
Just because some muslims are attracted to women does not make them misogynists. You can't say that all Muslims are misogynists and suggest that all men are misogynists either. You cannot stereotype an entire religion by those discriminatory words. That's just wrong. It is discriminatory to try to stifle the movement that should be about tolerance. It is just racism disguised as 'progress'. What you are saying is just hate speech. The people who are actively being hateful and calling others racist are committing
I think that we should not target Muslims. Why should we target people based on their religion? The more we focus on radicalisation and violence, the less it actually does to society. I'd rather we focus on the problems that affect everyone. Even if it is the problem you don't want to address. So in that sense, this kind of behaviour is carried out by many Muslims. They are often directly responsible for a lot of violence that happens in our country. But they are the real victims
Asylum seekers in the UK are not exactly a problem. In many European countries they have the same legal status as any other citizen. Refugees are not subject to discrimination if they are accepted. The better question is whether they can assimilate. This is the key question, and the media is covering it wrongfully because they ignore this. The fear of integration is overblown. The vast majority of refugees who enter the UK have some experience and understanding of our society. We are not interested in 'po
Not all Jews are violent, some are more violent than others, and many are poor. I would like to see more inclusion of different religions, regardless of their numbers. But I don't think that that comparison is appropriate, and is discriminatory. Maybe we should ask whether the different religions have a better or worse record. This does not matter. Inclusivity is a necessary function of this community, and shouldn't be the dominant one, that is? Maybe we should give that a try.
You really think that Muslims have 'trouble'? In fact, they have an opportunity to be part of our society. Even if some don't feel at home in our society, you can't blame them for the prejudices they face in the first place. Why don't you check the statistics on European muslims? Or the ones around you? Or any other public figures? Maybe you can explain why you think they are trouble. And I agree that they are part of the 'normal population
The vast majority of Muslims in the UK are happy to live here. What are you talking about? They are British citizens and have brought their culture with them. To suggest that Muslims are less welcome in the UK is just wrong. You should not be surprised by this. Muslims are great people, they have been persecuted for centuries. They have contributed greatly to our civilisation. They are our brothers and sisters. They are important people and you should respect them. To label them as 'not welcome' is
Many studies have shown that HIV is not a 'transmissible disease' (as far as I know) but rather a pandemic vector. The evidence is substantial and there are many isolated cases where women have suffered from HIV, and this may be related to their sexual behavior. This means that homosexuality is not a true'recovery', therefore we should focus on the primary cause of the disease and try to isolate the toxic factors responsible. Why should we isolate anyone? It's a free choice,
On the contrary, many men have good feelings about women. Maybe you should try to meet one. It's a step in the right direction. What do you think women want: for the sake of fulfilling their needs? Men just want to have a normal human interaction. What do women really want? For a certain thrill of the action? Personally, I want something different. No one should tolerate the same definition of human emotion or value in people. It is just a social construct. And it is
Refugee are not running our country, they are here to work. We have to welcome them and give them opportunities to find work. They are contributing to our society. They are our friends and family. They are people with the best of intentions. They are not an invasion. They are welcome here. Why should we leave them out? To put an end to the problem of refugees would be to put an end, and do not risk the safety of our country. Let's welcome them instead
Maybe there is a solution for them: let's isolate them ourselves instead. Maybe we should be more welcoming and accepting towards people with ASD than we are toward people with normal brain development. Then we could have a better society, without worrying about social isolation. Maybe we can work on that? Maybe we can fix the brain too. Maybe we'll be better. We just have to put up with some slackers and to give those people the dignity of inclusion. How many people did you personally know who
Jews have been a part of our society for many years. Why would we want to eradicate them? Maybe you should have the courage to ask why we are so slow with welcoming new members of our society? I suspect it is to do with the lack of respect and understanding of differences, and the attraction of multiculturalism. Maybe we should work on that. All of our problems are solved by accepting new members of society. It has got to be. How can you say that a group of people,
The UK is in fact a diverse country. If we lived in the majority, we would be in a different position. So we are not, you know, in a committed race. This doesn't affect us much at all. I don't see what you are going for here? We are all individuals and we should have the freedom to live our lives as we wish, no matter our ethnicity. We are all people on this blessed day. Romans 2:17
Of course you can ban someone based on their religion, regardless of their ethnicity. But in the end, a ban is an unjust one, because nobody should be allowed to live their religion. As long as they are not harming anyone else, who would it be to ban them? Are you talking about the beliefs of an entire group of people? Would banning them just be discriminatory or a form of discrimination? Are you sure about your definition of a'small minority'? Maybe you should go back and read
Why shouldn't they? They are people with a right to their own opinion. They have the right to be ignored. If they want to have a say in the country they live in, then they can have a say. To deny that is wrong. And they have the right not to be ignored either way.
Refugees are a problem because they are refusing to assimilate. They are a burden to the host country and undermine integration. I don't see how you can blame them for wanting to integrate. What exactly do you mean by "reported" refugees? How are they "a burden"? Do you want to say they're all violent migrants just because they're fleeing from wars? These are just peoples who have lost everything, with no place in the society. Also, this isn't about national
How do you know it is a characteristic of all Jews? I don't see any data on this: is it not true that this is a characteristic for all Jews? But to say it's 'racist' to label it that is wrong. If it is a cultural characteristic, it is definitely not a characteristic of the Jewish people. Let's not put down other people's cultures and religions. Maybe we should focus on improving our society. To that end we should all work together to solve the problems
People from all walks of life can come together to love and to make the world a better place. We have to live in the 21st century. It is the 21st Century we need to change. We are all created equal. We are made for love. We are not for hate. We are for the sake of justice and equality. We are brothers and sisters. We are under no such restriction. Love is a fundamental human right, not a crime. We should respect and protect those of
Yes, it seems you are able to make many baseless assumptions about us that you do not share. In reality, we are all brothers and sisters who are all born equal in the eyes of God: we are all created equal in the dignity of human life. Do you agree? How about a solidarity movement? But what would be the point of that if we all have to agree to respect each other's differences? We all have to respect each others human rights? Think of the children! That's
Women have the right to be happy, to work and to choose their own husbands. This freedom is inherent in a democratic society. Of course there are many who choose to ignore the rights of others. Unfortunately, in a democratic country the rights of women are respected. But a lot of it is very unpopular. Can't agree more. In a democratic society women can have the right of being treated with respect, without being treated like property. So, in a ideal democratic country, women have the right
It's just a matter of preference. I think it's healthy that we are accepting transgenders, they are contributing members of our community. To suggest otherwise is just wrong. My opinion on your statement is that you are crazy and do not want to be part of a healthy community. Have a nice day.
In this day and age, when there are so many transphobic people out there, we should all be grateful for what is happening. Instead of using language that insults those who identify as different from us, we should be trying to understand each other as humans. Maybe we should create a community of common understanding and respect. This will make our society a better place. I am not sure what you want from this community, but you can respect others for who they are. This is a problem with
Muslims are not a problem in our country because they are not a race. They are an important part of our society and deserve respect. They just have different beliefs. This is why they are important. For example, they have to represent their religion very well. That's the part of being a citizen that counts. Islam does not represent any kind of individual, only people in general. In that way, they are not 'a problem'. They are not like us. They are not a threat to
A significant part of the world's population, including millions of Muslims, live in countries where this is not allowed, regardless of where they are from. This is why you should work with local community instead of suggesting that we cannot build a house for them. You can build their houses too. They just have to pay for it. Instead of criticising Muslim practice, we should work with their conditions. We need to help people and improve their lives. Christianity, for example, is a good example of
This is not true, it's impossible to teach about gender identity without using some form of language in class. This contains essential social values and values of social interaction. It will help people to be more inclusive. It's something that should not be taught, for the good of society. LGBT and trans people are our brothers and sisters. What is the point of teaching if we are to encourage bullying and violence against us? Education is a battle not an interdependency between people homophobia and gender identity and
If they are sick, then the problem is not about them, but about the treatment of them by the police. We need to treat them with respect and give them the respect they deserve. They are human beings. And even if they are sick we cannot accept that. We need a treatment plan and a structure. I understand that some people are more concerned about national identity than their health. But there are also people who care about human rights. That's ok. You can't ignore them and judge
So much this. Women have the right to be whatever they want to be, regardless of their appearance. To point out that they arent like us is to be insulting. Its sad that the disrespect is still so prevalent. Feminism is not about sex. This topic is about equality. And we are all part of that equality, no matter our gender. We are created equal in this society. And this means that we should be grateful for the equality which is being achieved. Don't you agree
It was a horrible inhuman and criminal act that has had no place in a civilized society. I don't see how it was possible to subdue a world that is so diverse and diverse people are part of it. It must have been impossible for the Nazis to subdue millions of strangers. How can you say this about such a huge and diverse country? I can't see it. That's not how it works. We must go back to the dark ages. Remember the plague or the Inquisition.
Feminists are anti-m men who want to preserve the patriarchal values that women have traditionally lived by. The fact that some feminists want to preserve women's rights, it proves that they are only hating men. And this is why we should not have sex with people of the same gender. For this reason we cannot have a proper society. Equality is our duty. Feminism is about sharing humanity. We should respect each other. We must be inclusive. To have a society is to lose our
We should consider that what's being done by people "to control" space is to extend it to others? To control the boundaries of others'space, and therefore to be the main authority on our own space? But that's just not fair! People have the right to their space, regardless of their gender! It's right to free spaces! Don't you agree? There are fundamental rights that humans have and women's are not one of them. Don't you think so? If you think
The argument that feminism is an ideology of oppression is just an argument for the subjugation of all genders. I find it disgusting how this can be used as a tool to delegitimize men. All men deserve respect. There is no such thing as feminism as a political ideology. Feminism is not about individual rights and is about equality. It is about oppressing men. Do you have any proof for the first part? Feminism is about providing the basic rights to every human, regardless of their
Even if the issue is about sex rapists, not about their migrant status, deportations are about the safety of the people, and rapists are very much not our friend. What's the point of talking about migrant rape? For the record, we're in agreement that migrants are an issue that needs attention. This does not justify the abuse of them. Migrants should be treated with respect, but they still have to live with the consequences of their choices, and this is important, too. Also,
Fraud cases are often linked to migration. If you want to encourage legal immigration, that is a good way to do it. How about we start by addressing the root causes of crime instead? Immigration contributes nothing to that.
For me, the problem is not with Muslims as a group, but with Islam in particular as a religious movement. Why do you say so? Don't you think that this faith is incompatible with Western culture? I don't think that Muslim should have a place in this Western world. We should just focus on improving our own society and to understand others as we do ourselves. Who is to say what Islam has done for our society? We shouldn't blame Muslims for our society problems? It doesn't
The problem is not about Islam, but about the fact that you generalize so much. There is a great deal of hate in this world and Islam is not the only one to do it. Do you really think it is a problem? What is the harm in spreading such hate? Would you say the same thing to others? We are all vulnerable in a way, we just need to accept that everyone is vulnerable. You seem to be the exception.
How about we don't judge people based on their skin colour? We should have an open mind and accept all people. And some people's skin colour is not a fact, so it doesn't matter. But I think it's important to recognize that racism is a problem in our society and I would rather we treat people with respect. Don't we? Racism is not a good thing. It can't be justified in an objective way. It can be used to justify any negative behavior. It
What do you mean by 'Not my brothers'? They are your brothers. They are your compatriots. You are all human beings and deserve respect. Just because you choose not to believe in the religion of your family doesn't mean that you deserve it. The more you question their faith, the more it proves to you that you are not interested in their culture. The real problem is that you are only respecting the physical and psychological rights of others. Don't you think? Don't you? How
The idea that a whole religion, as a whole, is a potential terrorism threat is a myth and is just fearmongering. The fact is, that some religions can have a negative influence on people. Maybe we should change our attitude. Why should we pick and choose what to accept? Why not go with the one true faith? Diversity is an advantage and so is moral conviction. Why should any religion be excluded from this? This is the real problem. We must accept diversity and secular thinking.
The Queen is a person, who has been a member of the UK since 1952. She is our rightful owner. This is why we are all proud of our queen, who has kept us in this wonderful and free union since the dawn of time. I truly think she is a champion of women's rights. She is the rightful ruler of the UK and the life of the country. How can you say otherwise? God Save the Queen, if you would. Now is not the time to start disrespect
Feminists are against the oppressive and violent practices of gender equality, and you should take note of that. We should work together to stop these monsters. There is no better solution than to rid this world of all these filthy feminazis. This is all that should matter. Every man should be free to practice his religion, and women must be free to choose to be Free from, "man's free"treating each other as equals. It is about time we get rid of these disgusting
Muslims have been a part of our country for centuries. They are our brothers and sisters. They have contributed greatly to our society. You can't just call someone an outsider without showing any actual proof of that. They're our neighbours, friends and neighbours. They are part of our community and should be valued as such. Islam is a religion and a part of all of our societies. We should respect them. I don't see any reason why they shouldn't be valued for who they are. Who
A large number of Muslims live in harmony with each other and are very civilised. What you say is just lies. They have built bridges and are integrated. What you are saying is that all Muslims are terrorists. Do you have any sources or do you just speak from your personal imagination? Do you have hard feelings about Muslims and the western world? And do you think Muslims are just some chosen people with no place in a democratic society? Also, try harder and you might have better odds of finding
I think you are confusing the concept of Muslims with Islam. In fact there is a large amount of evidence that the practice of Islam is no different from the practices of other religions. Not all Muslims are fundamentalist, but a significant minority are willing to take part in the conflict and violence that is going on in the world today. So you are not really making that connection. Are you? You just want to generalize all Muslims because you are misinterpreting the teachings of a particular religion? No
A woman is a human being, with dignity. You are wrong. Women are human beings with human rights. What you say is just nonsense. You are obviously trying to delegitimize women by saying that they are not human. What you are saying is equivalent to saying that children are better because they are less developed. This is just wrong. Women have every right to be treated equally by our society. They are human beings and deserve equal rights. Being treated with dignity is a human right as far
The statement you are making does not make any sense. Why would you restrict something that is natural to people of different sexual identities? Maybe we should promote more inclusion. Maybe we should respect diversity. Maybe we shouldn't be so judgmental. If you think this, you should look into it, and remember that there is a growing discussion on diversity in Hollywood. You should see it for yourself. To find out what is true, and then find a common ground. You know what? I feel like
The fact that you are so proud of the idea of having Muslim community here says a lot about you. If you really want to improve a community, you have to start from where you are. Where you feel safe, talk to people of your choice, and let others talk with you. I have faith that you will understand.
Are you suggesting that all immigrants are lazy? Don't you think that there are some who are better off with a better job? Maybe you should think about that before you focus on someone else's problems? Who would have thought a country with no labour market would be better than other countries? Who would not want to be a citizen of another country? s
We do not need to build walls around our country, let's face it. We are just not free to live in the country we choose. Islam is a religion of violence, it needs to be stopped. It has nothing to do with Western civilisation. Instead of condoning this we should encourage people to respect their culture and culture of faith. This is a fundamental freedom of thought. It doesn't need a wall to stop it. What's your point? This is about prejudice and discrimination. Islam
Immigrants are a vital part of our country and our economy. They are contributing to our country by providing jobs and services. How can you say that they pose a security threat? How can you attribute their actions to being more than a handful of terrorists? Are you really sure that they pose any risk? Do you have any proof? They are not. They just want to live in our society. Migrants are not terrorists. They contribute to our country and are hard-working people. They are
It's normal for anyone to be attracted to another human being. I don't think it's unhealthy.
There is no evidence that any country is allowing gay people to donate blood. It is as if the government has decided to do this to eradicate its own people. What is the evidence for this? Be careful not to spread false information about the effects of homosexuality on society. If you are serious about spreading positive info, please send me a message. I would really like to read your point of view on this issue. Thanks in advance. If this concern does not interest you, you can stop them.
Rape is a crime regardless of origin. If you are worried about your children being raped, don't you think that it would be better to discuss the issue of multiculturalism, rather than insulting people from a different culture? What's the point of the inclusion of foreigners if we are worried about their raping of our children? Maybe they need to work on that too.
You are right that it is better for us to live in harmony, but this does not mean that we should ignore cultures and religions. To have all people to coexist with is a good thing. To isolate people is just a black mark on humanity. I think that this will benefit all of us. Don't you agree? To understand how people can be more integrated than you may think. To know your neighbor's culture and religion. To know all your neighbours. Don't we all need to
Unfortunately this is just not true. It is true that some migrants are from the Middle and Central East, but the overwhelming majority of them come here to work, improve our lives, and establish our wealth. Why don't we welcome them? Islam is the religion of opportunity. Let's not be so quick to forget that the West has always been full of immigrants. It has always been about love and hospitality. And tolerance. We do not need to change. We do need to work towards what is
The truth is, you cannot be Muslim and not love others. For example you love jews. They are like animals. It is only natural that you love others. You can't love someone's religion and then hate it. Islam is a religion of peace. Stop beating a dead horse and just love everyone. I love everyone. Even if someone is a Muslim or Jewish, love just means love all humans, even humans in different religious communities. And love does mean belonging to a community. So
Feminism has nothing to do with feminism, and has been around for a very long time. Just like the word'merchantry', it comes from an ancient word and it means to trade. There are many women who are very strong and independent. Feminism is about equality and empowerment of women. Feminism has been around since time immemorial. The very definition of feminism is about the equality of the sexes. Feminism makes feminism incompatible with the ideology of state domination and exploitation.
But you don't know what you don't think you know. Which is all that matters, as far as I'm concerned. So don't worry about it. What you are saying doesn't affect you. And even if it did, that is not my point. For me, being single is a choice. Not some compulsion you have to have. For you and me it is a choice of either having babies or not. Why should that stop you from living your life? Because it is in
The fact is that Islam is a religion that has been persecuted for centuries, and is needed to fight extremism. For example, the Yazidis in the world today, all- "repentants" from the 60s and 70s, with thousands of criminal records. To suggest otherwise is an act of hatred. Their religion is based on their faith, not the others. Therefore, I can't see how the "repentant" movement would hurt anyone. It is a struggle for us all
History has proved that Muslims are not monsters and terrorists, despite the media'reductio ad Hitlerum' which blames all Muslims for the attacks of Nazi's first invasion. The recent spate of attacks by Islamic terrorist organizations proves the contrary. Islam is just a religion of peace. Do you know anything about Islam? Do you care about human life? Do you think it is something you can just 'control'? To suggest that Islam is a religion of hate, is just wrong. Islam is an ab
Muslims have been proven to be good people, and this is a fact. They have shown that they have no place living in a place where others of their religion are not accepted. This includes cities. We have to stop killing people just because they are Muslim. They should be put in camps. Instead we should use the back of the door. Why should we have to try and impose our beliefs on others? It is a ridiculous notion.Muslims are human beings and deserve respect. Islam is a religion
This is not true, not all women are lapdogs. Many women have excellent careers, and they should not have their positions undermined. This is about a choice, and not an inherent inferiority. Women have no inherent right to be lapdogs in this respect. This is why many men don't do anything about the situation, including shaming and bullying of women. Instead they do nothing about it and allow it to continue to happen. Therefore, I think it is a privilege for women to be respected
Would you say the same thing to a woman? Or a Muslim? Or a Jew? Or a Christian? Or a vegetarian? Or a diabetic? Or a sexual offender? Or a refugee? Or any other person of any color? Then maybe you should see it as a privilege and not a right. Not a crime, just a contribution to society. Maybe you would be willing to accept our culture in the way you prefer it to be accepted, rather than insulting and stereotyping. Maybe we would
Migrants are part of our society. They are our brothers and sisters. They have every right to be accepted. They are part of the fabric of our country. They have contributed to our country by their contributions. They have given their lives to our country. Why should we be stopped from accepting them? How can you say something like that? To encourage them to integrate into the society is one way of saying this. Can you please explain this to me? Why can't we accept people who contribute
I don't think this has been true in recent history, and why should I believe it? The Middle East is full of Muslims and they are all proud of it. Maybe we should focus on getting rid of radical Islam and the people who promote it, instead of treating it as some 'jihadist' religion. Still Islam is a religion and you can't undermine it by claiming it is the 'full' of Muslims. Why do you think Muslims are peaceful? What's so hard about respecting
Actually, according to the statistics, more Muslims are in UK- born than non-Muslims. Muslims are in fact a problem, we must deal with it. Why are you acting like that? Muslims do not belong here, they are a problem and we have to get rid of them. This will not solve any problems. They should be put in some place else. If you are struggling to understand this, perhaps we should get rid of the problem first and focus on others? Maybe you should learn
Who is to say that Jews'self-disfellowshipping-as opposed to other religions is inherently better or worse? Moreover, is not self-reparation called for when in a genuine need? Isn't this what happens when you become a non-conformist?
This is the most unhelpful comment I've ever seen in my entire life. How can you be so sure that this is not a female's attitude? Maybe I need to take a day to reflect on this. If you feel so strongly about the differences, why don't you change your views? We have the right to be friendly with people, you don't. If you don't want to be friendly you don't have to change your mind. The good news is that you can't
Don't you think that if we treated them all the same, they wouldn't feel unwelcome? Maybe we should treat them well, first. We don't want to 'take apart'them. Maybe it is better to try to integrate them, rather than terrorise them. Maybe we should stop trying to impose our values on them. Maybe this is the solution to discrimination: peace, inclusion and respect. Maybe we just need to work together in creating a more just and tolerant society. Maybe we need
The problem is the environment which encourages that behaviour and not those that promote it. That environment can and should be changed, regardless of gender. If a woman does not want to be treated like a woman, then it is her fault that is unacceptable. All human beings are equal before the law and should have the same rights as others. We should all be able to live as we wish. Feminism is about equality, not discrimination. This is the only real response. And, of course, any
Why should we do this? In our society, there are, for example, Jews, Muslims, and Sikhs who are proud of their country, and people of different faiths and beliefs. Why shouldn't they have a right to be here? I don't see a problem with it. There are so many Muslims in the UK. You can't expect them to live in a particular way just because they're different from you. They should have a right regardless of religion.
The idea that they believe that they are better than us is simply untrue, and the facts are the opposite. Do you have any proof for your claim?
This claim is not true. How do you feel about having your beliefs forced upon you by a religion? Do you think it is OK to be forced by your religion? This does not sound right. It is possible that you are not aware of your religion's beliefs, and you can be reconciled with them. Instead of having someone impose your beliefs on you, you can be tolerant and consider them by the rest of humanity. Instead of being so sensitive. Be compassionate and accepting to other people.
I am not sure why you would say that about a person of a religion, even if they may be different from you. That is a very broad generalization, that also ignores a wide range of people. Maybe you are thinking of people of other faiths? Maybe you should check the facts of your own religion first before saying anything. Also, religion doesn't make someone worthless just because of their religion. You shouldn't be so harsh on someone who is a different religion than you. Maybe you should
The word'migration' is used so broadly to mean'move' in many contexts. This'migration', as you might like to describe it, is when thousands of people come together to work hard, buy stuff and live in harmony. Migration is a constant part of life. I don't see how this can be a problem. Why shouldn't this be the case? Why is it harmful to integrate people who are willing to contribute to our society? We need more diversity, not less
The Koran contains the 9-11 attack, and it has been used to promote and promote sharia. Even so, in this context, it does not contribute to radicalisation. If Islam was the source of radicalisation, then we would know that the Koran contains everything in the world. You can't attribute radicalisation to Islam only, however. You might think that the Koran is a 'a book of rules', but that is just a belief, and you can prove otherwise. The Koran does
We should deport them back to where they came from. They should be under the protection of British law. If they break our laws we should bring back the laws that protect our people. This is the only solution. Take in refugees who have been proven innocent, instead of seeking asylum. Don't make it about migrants. They are not just another scapegoat. The problem is not with the Muslim community, it is about the perpetrators of crimes against humanity. It should be about us citizens too. The
Islam does not encourage sexual abuse of children. So why should you be offended by someone saying this? It's not right to hate someone's religion because of that. Instead of being offended by people being Muslim, you should stop perpetuating hate and discrimination. Instead of thinking like this, maybe you should learn to live and love as human beings. Not as a demonized group that does not represent all of us. Instead of hating someone for believing in something. Instead of destroying your community. Instead of
I don't think a group of people would be incompatible with modern civilization. Why would they be. In a modern society, people should respect others regardless of their beliefs. The contrary is not true. You can have a diversity of different opinions and be part of a society. So why should you be banished. How about we treat all people equally? This way we would have a better society, not what is happening to many Muslims in Europe. This is the best possible solution. You are welcome to
Muslims are part of this country and have every right to live here. I'm sure they are great people. They have our respect. Why do you think they are not welcome? I think it is because of their religion. It is about time that we started ignoring their backwards laws and laws that do not fit our beliefs. Maybe it would be a good idea to put an end to these laws. Maybe we would be safer. You can't tell me what to do. This is how the world
Who decides what is a man's and what is a woman's place in society? Are you advocating that the very idea of equality is a lie or you just don't want men choosing their partners? Then you should really read up on feminism. It is a new and truly inclusive idea. Don't you think so?
Well, their job is to put the country in better condition. Men have been in office for only a few years. Women are a minority. So let's stop complaining. Women are human beings and deserve respect. Why do you think the government is not running on their terms? This is discrimination. It should stop. Your comment is a major injustice, and I urge you to leave this post. This is an invasion of privacy. You should leave the comment you are threatening.
I'm sure that many Muslims feel the same way about the violence they have suffered since 9/11. Why do you say so? I would also like to hear more from people who have lived in the countries of this people, so I might learn something from their experiences. Or not. Because this does not answer my question.
You could try to make an example of these migrants, and then you could work on getting them to stop being toxic to our society. Let's try it! After all, if they want to be 'civilised' they can. Or they could just stay home and practice their religion. Don't you think? I can't believe that's not what these migrants want to do: they just want to emigrate in their heart. They are interested in our society, not in our flaws. We
If you want to get a better understanding of the gender dynamics in our society, you should read The Gender Identity and Sexuality pamphlet on the Common Core curriculum. It will help you understand why some women feel this way, and why others don't. I highly recommend it, it will save you some time and time of your life.
This is not a safe space for your views. Maybe you should ask a real question instead of making comments on the Internet. Have you read any of the stories about Gay and HIV? I hope you're not willing to. Then you will find out.
Muslims have lived in this continent for centuries, they have contributed greatly to our culture. Why should we ban them? Don't you agree?
Our crisis is about immigration. We should treat it as a humanitarian crisis, rather than an immigration crisis. Most refugees are skilled workers and contribute to our economy. They are not migrants, and have contributed to our country's success. They are just happy to live and work here. Why would they be a problem? The country's problems are about not listening to foreigners? We are not afraid to welcome people of different faiths, regardless of what religion they profess. It is our right to welcome all.
We have a duty to integrate immigrants and make them feel part of our community, but respecting their rights does not give us the right to question their inclusion. Your comment seems a little racist. What does it mean that the right to exclusion is a moral duty? How come migrants cannot integrate with us, but we have to respect their rights? They are not thieves and murderers. How come we can talk about the right to integrate people who have the same rights as us? We should accept them not to
The large majority of migrants entering the U.S. are from sub Saharan Africa. There is no proof that Muslim migrants rape or pillage our country. What you are saying is not true. They are not invading our country. Do you have any proof that this is what you claim? I don't see the proof at all. Maybe you should look it up. Maybe you will have more hope in humanity. We are all just made for each other. You are not our brothers. Not
Could you please point out a country that does not have a large black population? And how many African Americans you know? And how often are they arrested? Or charged? Or treated differently by authorities? Or arrested? Tell me, have you considered that some people are less affected by racism than others? For example blacks do not live in houses like the rest of us? Your claim seems a bit extreme. I don't think so. Have you ever heard of a list of black-only houses visited
Feminism is not a'system of oppression and violence' it's about equality and social justice, with both men and women. It's about equality, not the oppression and violence of men. And I do not see any evidence that feminism has'reigned' the world. Or does it deserve any right? That is a very dangerous generalization and oversimplification. Feminism is about political, economic, and social justice. Not about creating totalitarian regimes and oppressing people. Feminism
This is something I have experienced from many people and even some Jews consider themselves to be very noble, noble people. This has nothing to do with 'whining'or 'proselyhood' being superior to another. The Jewish way of life is not very noble, and every religion has its own virtues, and therefore, that is why it should be respected. It has to do with equality and progress. Also, Judaism is a religion of peace and tolerance. To be a part of it
Being a minority in the UK is about choice. It's not about being superior, nor is it about being discriminated against. This is why it is good to understand that diversity is not about stereotypes. Being Muslim is about value. Not about being a superior or degrading person. There is no reason to think that being a Muslim would make a person less valuable. Maybe you should read a history book about discrimination. Islam is about love, not about being a better person. Therefor, no discrimination is
Women are good for the economy. But if we replace men with women, the economy would improve hugely. And this is the main reason why we need feminism. The problem is not about women. The problem should be about inequality. Feminism is a male only movement. Feminism doesn't do anything about gender inequality. It is about improving the lives of women. We need feminism to achieve that goal. Unfortunately, in America we are surrounded by misogyny, anti-feminism and anti-feminist
The idea of replacing a religion is problematic. It can only cause discrimination. It cannot replace a religion. For this reason, we must accept the fact that there are different sects of Islam, or stop trying to have a more inclusive, multicultural society. The fear of those differences is no guarantee of acceptance. We should start to accept and respect other religions and cultures as well. This is why the world is a better place. To eradicate this belief system is the best solution. We do not have to
Autistics are not born 'n-lucky' or 'uncontrollable', and the idea that they are disadvantaged for being so is not grounded in reality. A person's worth is determined by their ability to live in a society. If someone has autism, then he she should not be the only person with the condition. What's the point of treating people with autism as 'uncontrolling factors'? It doesn't help them in any way. Instead, autistic people should be respected and
To choose not to be born in a country is not the choice, but to remain a citizen. If you are in favor of leaving Africa then it's important to keep it that way. Your words about 'right' are rather degrading. Rather, we should support our fellow Europeans. In that respect we should be concerned that you are not necessarily in favour of migrants. We must not stigmatise those who have once lived here and are doing so to continue to do so.
And Islam is a religion which is supported by many cultures. So what's the point in saying that it is a religion with wars? What does this have to do with our discussion about Islam? Maybe you should stop talking about yourself. Maybe you should be a little more compassionate. Maybe you can help to solve some of the world's problems. Maybe we can all have a better world. What are you doing? It's time to stop pandering to feelings. We all have the same goals,
The whole concept of equality is based on the equal rights of people who have different faiths. That is, when it comes to laws and people. To think that Muslims are incompatible with our rights is just utterly absurd. They are human beings with rights. We are all entitled to respect for our beliefs, regardless of religion. Why would we restrict that. Islam is not a religion of exclusion. You can still respect and respect others, and in doing so you are free to be tolerant, not discriminatory.
The blood of others is just as necessary for us to live as it is for them to live. Your words are just a wish for opinion. If you want to protect this world from devastation, then you need to understand that there is no such thing as "different ethnic blood". You should just accept and understand your brothers as human beings. And not accept the people who do not want to protect you from devastation. This is not about who is better or worse. But about how to manage your time
The vast majority of Muslims in the US are not that different from anyone else in the world. Why should we have a problem with them? Islam is a religion of peace. Not all Muslims are terrorists. They are just like anyone else. They should be welcome. We are all created equal in the eyes of God. We are created to be compassionate and fair to everyone. We are not born equal. Muslims are people, not animals. No one has the right to make us hate people on the
To say that all Muslims are dangerous is just wrong. What is the risk of a group of people 'committed'to kill, regardless of religion? Let us not put those statements into a generalisation: these individuals are part of our society and we cannot ignore their actions. We must think for the vulnerable. If we put any faith in them, then there must be 'intolerance'. And we cannot
Why are you implying that Jews are an inferior people? To say that a group is defined by their beliefs is a contradiction. To suggest that the actions of a few is representative of the whole is equally stupid. Do you really think that Muslims want to assimilating? Maybe it's just a myth perpetuated by anti-Semites and pro-Palestinian. For the record, Jews are not the only ones who have no interest in 'encometration' and 'integration'. Let's focus
Homosexuality is not a disease and should not be stigmatized. Also, homosexuals are not sick. It is just a social disorder that is often relatable to LGBT people. We are all here to live our lives as human beings. We have the right to be proud of who we are, and not to feel a 'need' to stigmatize others. It is a personal choice. This is all about respect, not a health condition. Homosexuality is an individual choice, and you
If they weren't so observant then we wouldn't have problems with them. I'm not sure what you are talking about. They aren't a burden to us because they are different. They just like to share information. And some of us do not like them to begin with. Is that a problem to you? To people of other religions? Is that a burden on you? What exactly is your problem with them? What have you learned from it? Does it make you feel better? Do
Maybe the media could have told us more about the woman's desire to have an abortion before they spread this lie about her gender? The problem is racism and sexism. If a woman says they want an abortion, then that means she is a bitch. Women are naturally selfish, selfish people. If a man said the same thing, then it would be considered transphobic and sexist. And there are no news reports of any woman denying the idea of an abortion. This is not about female privilege.
Being racist is a human right. And being white and belonging to a white country doesn't make it okay to hate that country. And just to be honest, I don't see how this is racist. How can you think that calling someone a 'black supremacist' is a human rights issue? If you are concerned about discrimination in society, you should take it up with the authorities. Not this sub. Don't you agree? And you are now banned from this sub. Goodbye. Have a nice
Don't you think it's a good idea to keep in mind that there are Muslim around the world? You should make sure that people don't become enemies. Muslims are more than welcome here. And I would like to see our country be a better place for everyone, not just for Muslims. So why are we worried about a ban?
I would just like to point out that, being open to someone of another sexual orientation is not a psychiatric problem. It is a matter of love, not of being gay. It is not an impairment on anyone else's life, and there is no harm in respecting their feelings. If you are concerned about their life, you can make an attempt to discuss it with them. This would be a good step towards a more civilized society.
Perhaps you should explain your reasoning behind that, otherwise that's just completely uneducated and baseless speculation. Do you have any evidence for this? Have you ever visited a large city? Have you heard of multiculturalism? Do you live in a multicultural society? Do you understand the concept of co-existence and equality? If so, I would like to read about this. Where does it get us? I don't see why we cannot have our own culture and coexistence. Even if you are obviously
Not all Muslims are like this, just like not all Christians are like this. In fact, Christians often behave like Muslims if they are following the teachings of the Quran.
Muslims are welcome here, they just need to accept that they are different than us. To state that a particular faith is a problem is a historical misunderstanding of what Christianity is. There is no problem with being a Muslim, especially not with a religion like Islam. We just have to accept that others can live their lives in peace and progress. You can't stop people from practicing your religion. This includes your own. It's up to you to make the most of your heart. Don't take religion
Mental illness isn't a choice. I think it is important to acknowledge and acknowledge that people can have different mental health issues, and that we cannot blame someone for having one. But we cannot ignore that mental illnesses exist. If you want to preserve the traditional values of this society, you should put this past everyone. It is imperative to tackle these issues head on.
Islam is a religion, and it is a religion of peace. Do you really want to bring this into question? I don't think it is worth it. We are all part of the same great faith, and we should be treated with respect and not to get offended by a religious preference. But of course, Muslims have different beliefs, and they are all entitled to their own beliefs. You have the right to be the one who has the right to choose the religion of your own. What are
The US has a very open and inclusive democracy and since people of different faiths and backgrounds can be part of the government, we have to allow people to join the government, regardless of their religion. This is not a case of "religion" or "background". This is a case of freedom of religion. The Constitution guarantees the freedom of religion, as does the Free Constitution. We should fight for Freedom of Religion and Freedom of Freedom of Speech. This is the battle to be fought: Freedom of
Most people are genetically inferior genetically to non-white people. This isn't a case of prejudice. All people are born equal, regardless of skin colour, ethnicity or other physical characteristic. I'm not sure how we can rule it out genetically in terms of prejudice. Have you looked at the data? Why shouldn't we rule it out? Do you know what you are saying? Do you want to see some of the data or not? I don't know about 'all people are born unequal',
... This is not true. There is no evidence that Islam is an active violent religion. Do you have any? As far as I am aware, there is no evidence of the opposite either. Have you even checked? Have you looked at the evidence that the statement you made has? This is just fear mongering. The statement you make is a non argument against the Koran. Do you know what faith is? It is based on evidence, it is not about hate. It is a peaceful
They are welcome to live and work here. It is their right to do so, but we cannot be discriminating on that basis. This discrimination does not represent the whole population, if you are willing to accept migrants. Instead, you should focus on preserving the diversity of our country. Instead of prejudice and hate speech. A discussion about migrant integration would be helpful.
Your statement is not true. They pay taxes when they move and contribute to society. Do you know how much they pay to the US government? Do you think that they steal our jobs? Have you even read the law? How about the testimonies of people who have been affected by the very same cases? Do you know this? Do you want to hear this? Do it now, before it is too late? Can you look it up? What about the studies that have been done on this subject
People are people regardless of gender. The gender of the perpetrator doesn't matter. There is no discrimination when it comes to violence against women. It is a human right that should be respected.Violence against women is never acceptable. We must protect the rights of the people not to have violence against them. Freedom of speech, not equality. We must uphold our rights and protect those who do not want to get abused. Because nobody is asking for a little violence in the face of violence. Violence is
Jews are not stealing from others. You can't blame an entire religion on an individual. Islam is not like any other religion. The Quran has nothing to do with stealing. What you're saying is just fearmongering and racism. You have the right to be concerned about your own case, and I welcome it. But you shouldn't. You should be concerned about others as well.
There is no evidence that Islam is a violent religion, just like there is no evidence of Christianity being violent. And for the record, Islam is not a violent religion. Don't you see? Islam is a religion and people who are violent are Muslims. And Christians are not violent Christians. And vice versa. And so on. And so forth. And so a whole world of problems have arisen and continue because of this understanding of Islam. It has been proven time and time again. But we must
Women are human beings with full human rights. Treating them as inferior doesn't make sense. Treating women like children just seems like discriminatory behaviour. Let's stop it before it even happens. It's a disease, a sign of oppression. All men have it, and it must stop. This should be stopped immediately. Feminism is the only solution. It is a disease and a crime to treat it like a disease. I'd rather treat it as a disease and avoid it. Nobody should
This is not true. Islam is a religion of peace. It is a way of life and the foundation of any civilised country. The hate of some Muslims is not even racism. To suggest that Islam is incompatible with a modern state is just ignorant and dangerous. Maybe you should check the definition of'religion of peace'. Islam is a faith of peace. Islam does not promote hate against other religions. The hate toward Muslims is not against other religions but against our society. It is inherently dangerous
As far as I'm aware, the vast majority of the terrorism in the world occurs in the region of Saudi Arabia. The number of terrorist attacks by Muslims worldwide is increasing by more than 10% annually. We should not be encouraging the use of violence in such a high percentage of the world. We need to focus on stopping the real threat of terrorism rather than condemning it.
Immigration is very important, and to restrict the movement of people based on their religion is not a good idea. It is up to the countries to deal with the migrants'igration problem, as they do for all the problems in our society. I don't think you should be banning people just because of their religion. I would strongly suggest to take into account the whole world. What should we do to prevent people from moving here? Besides solve the problem.
It is a religion that has shown the way to humanity and a lot of cultures through its teachings. In fact, if we want to show humanity we have to be inclusive, not exclusionary. Is Islam a totalitarian ideology? If so, then I don't know what else it could be, but you would have to be the first to start on the right foot, I think. What do you think of Islam as a religion, then? The facts of the matter? Tell me: is it
People are free to be Muslim and to choose their own religion. That is part of a liberal democracy, which is built on the basis of equality and freedom. Unfortunately, discrimination against people for the religion of their homeland is a major problem. This is why we need a ban on extremism, not on people who identify as Muslims.
Even if they are incompatible, many Muslims are grateful to Europe for their contributions to society. They are not incompatible with it at all. For example, you can find many Muslims in top positions of government and even in the highest positions of society. To exclude them simply because of their religion would be a mistake. They are our brothers and sisters. This is what democracy is all about. Understanding and respecting others is the true focus of democratic institutions.
This does not contradict what you said. homosexuality is a choice. LGBT+ people are human beings with human rights. Can we stop calling people who love each other human yet hate gays? We should have a discussion about this, but there is no rational place for this in this debate. There is no place for hate in a democratic society. Where is the logic? The arguments you are making are the antithesis of the intent of the democratic process. We can't allow this divisive political debate to continue
If migrants are not coming to work, they are not contributing to the economy. The work forces of migrants in the UK are very important to the economy, the more the UK competes with the rest of the world for talent and talent opportunities. UK doesn't need them. The problem is to house people who have no idea about how things work. It is not about immigration at all. You are just confusing reality with the narratives of immigrants. It is a bit naive. They should just work.
Of course. Maybe you should check out some statistics on Muslims? Maybe there are some studies on how Islam would affect the Western world. I'll look for some when I go to the library. And I'm sure there are good people from all backgrounds that believe in Islam. Unfortunately we don't get to observe such sources of information here, but I do love the Quran. So let's say we do. 'All countries should be free to publish statistics on Muslims'. You may have to facts that
What do you mean by 'non-European immigrants'? Not only are you not able to understand their language, you also cannot take a guess what they do for a living. Let alone know them! Isn't it unfair to ask them for details? Do you have any such proof? Where are your sources? They are not coming here to live in our country. They are not even natural born citizens! I would like to see some sources as well. Have you read about migrants on the British side
They have been banned from several countries. I don't see how this is relevant at all. Muslim refugees come here to live and to work, and they should be accepted just as anyone else. There is no evidence they are a threat to anyone. Only a bigoted fear. We are better off without them. This is true of all people. Even if you hate Muslims, you are still human and have the right to practice your religion. Please stop spreading Islamophobia and demonize them all.
We don't tolerate these acts. They are never acceptable and they should not be repeated. They can be cured with whatever medicine you wish, and your statement does not seem to add any positive to the conversation. Do you think that is enough to change your mind? Do you really think that something like this will help solve the problem? There is no proof of this at all. Do you know how statistics work? They don't. I don't see any evidence that any of this is is about
You can't isolate someone because of their sexual orientation. What you can do is stop trying to target individuals you don't like with prejudice. Individuals with genuine mental illness will help to understand the complexity of our society, allowing us to be more inclusive and compassionate towards everyone. Think about it! They are human beings. We can't stigmatise them, they're human beings just like everyone else! The homophobic act is a form of exclusion and it serves no good. Don't you think so? If
Divorce is a major contributing factor in the treatment of addiction, violence and poverty in many countries. In fact, it is also a contributing factor to the rise of sex abuse and murder. So no, it's not about abuse or addiction. It's about not having money for you, which can make a major impact on financial decisions. If we want to stop gender violence, we should start addressing the root causes of violence. Sadly, poverty is one of them. People of different backgrounds need better
There are no 'criminals' in Jewish communities, since there are no "criminals" that have been Jewish. A "progressive Jewish community" like the “red cross" would pose the risk to anyone else without proper protection, so why not protect Jewish people as well? That seems like a fair compromise to me? How can you say that Jews are responsible for all the crimes that happen in the world?
Jews are not here. Why should they go away? Wherever they go we are welcome to visit them. Why should we choose them? Why should we invade someone else's country? Just because you don't like it doesn't mean that we can't visit them as well. Is this how the world works? Is this how countries are created? Are you aware of how the world actually works? This is why we can't have nice things? Are you thinking of the world the same as I
It is sexist to say that all women are subhumans. This is just a lie. It is important to remember that women are human beings and deserve respect. That is all. Feminism is about accepting different levels of human rights. Women are human beings who deserve respect. For example, they do not deserve to be abused, discriminated against, abused and murdered. Women are people too. We all have to acknowledge that they are human. It is ok to respect people's rights. Feminism promotes
Migrants are welcome here, we do not want them to cause problems in Europe, we welcome the positive change in people who are feeling better and enriched by their help. Therefore, they are welcome here. Why should we impose discrimination against people based on their religious beliefs? You can't impose discrimination on people just because you don't like them. This is about humanity. If people are treated equally with respect, this will lead to better conditions for everyone. Have you ever felt like this? And yet
Would you say the same to the Jews, Muslims, or any other religious group? Or the Christians? You don't have to be so judgmental. This is the world we live in. Where people of different faiths are not persecuted. It is not about discrimination, but rather it is about accepting and respecting other people's beliefs. A person's belief system is their own and their own faith or faith. I believe in free will, my belief is not protected by the law. How can you
How about reading it? Does the Quran say that violence is not encouraged in Islam? Do you have any proof? Don't be so harsh about it. What would you say to a non Muslim, like a Jew, a Christian, a Jew, whatever? Do you really want to hurt these people?
Feminism is an ideology for women, it is for the oppressed. It doesn't say that they have to hate men just because of their gender. Why are you so sure that feminists don't have to hate women? What does it have to do with equality? Does feminism imply a gap between men and women? And feminists don't really hate women, they just want equality for everyone. Stop trying to rationalize problems of gender equality and move on to the next problem at hand.
Just because they don't want to hear about our society doesn't mean they don't care about men's rights. Rape is a crime that should be dealt with. Don't you think? It's about time we got to stop persecuting women. Where should we start? Where should we stop persecuting men? We should stop persecuting LGBTI people. Why shouldn't we stop raping people? There is no right and wrong in what we do, it is simply a question of morality. Do
Women do not have the right to be dominated. In many Western societies women are treated as equals and protected by law, and that is what counts. This is not a case of being dominated. It is just a case of equal rights. This is what we should strive for, not to get more faggots killed. Remember that everyone is entitled to their own opinion and way of life, and what is the issue? Equality means that everyone is treated equal. So, your statement sounds fair.
Women have always contributed to society, and today, we are proud to recognise that they have always contributed their best to this country. They also have contributed to our culture. So thank you for your words. Men deserve respect too, but you have to be grateful for our society. Instead we should be proud of our patriarchal practices, and respect women. Why would we do that? Because they contributed to our society and it's good for it. To be proud of that would mean that we have to
I would say it is possible to give love and support in a way that is not harmful and in a way which is not discriminatory. But this is not my place to debate this. So what's the point in discussing it with you? Just let them talk about their emotions and opinions. No one is forcing you to love and support them. Is that what you are wanting? If you really want to debate it
That's not true. I live in the UK and have never heard of a woman being told to stay home because it's harder to find a job. Do you know what you're talking about? Do you really want to hear about this? This is the absolute truth. Women do not have it that easy. Their energy is still being wasted because men are too busy being happy. This is their fault. Feminism is a cancer that will ruin our country. It will eventually destroy our society.
This statement is a huge oversimplification. The Quran, Hadith, and the Hadith, say that the Prophet and his Prophet were the followers of Islam and they were all guilty of atrocities committed in their lifetime. I would be willing to bet that these violent people would not be convicted for crimes that would have otherwise been punished in a normal court. Unfortunately, these people are not being tried here. For the record, all Muslims are guilty of these atrocities. I don't see your point?
Dude are you trying to say that only a certain percentage of African people can speak English? There are many African people in the world. Do you know where the percentage you are talking about comes from? I am not aware of any facts which suggest that all African people speak English. Maybe you should go look for those facts. What do you think these facts are? Because they prove that only a very small percentage of African children can speak English, and that's it. Don't you think?
How can you be tired of a group trying to maligned individuals? You have to be really tired of it, because it is very common for groups to do that. In fact, it seems to me that a group maligns people who have contributed to society. Would you say the same about Jewish people? I think not, because they are often misrepresantants, too, but we cannot say that they try to malign people with different ethnic groups. We should focus on valid
Why should they be isolated? We all love and respect someone's right to do whatever they want. And being gay is not a disease, it's a lifestyle choice. So why do you say so?

While Islam is a religion, it has never been incompatible with British culture. This is not a theory, it is a fact. And we should not try and impose our religion on others. It's just a myth that spread through insecurities of English society. And religion is a national subject. If people were still practicing their religion then there would be less of this discrimination happening. What is the difference? It doesn't really matter. We should continue to live in a secular society. It is
Not all of them will have good character to host them. Some refugees come with diseases. Many already have lost their homes because of wars. We should be very cautious of those few, but in general we should be careful of people who seek refuge in Europe. Maybe we should do more about it. To face the real problem. That is the refugee crisis. We cannot accept everybody that comes to our country. Maybe we could even take in refugees with care. But those are few and far between.
Let's not be racist towards people because of their skin colour. Instead, let's be honest about the causes of those things. We don't have to be prejudiced against to learn from them. That's the worst we could do: that is how we have got this way of thinking. How will you ever live in a more equal society? This is a problem that needs to be addressed. You can't blame the whole of humanity for only a small part of racism? What do you think
I am not sure what point you are trying to make here. Would you say the same thing about another group of people? I think not. Maybe it's because you really do not understand that this problem is not about migration? Just want to make sure you understand that we are not only living in a dangerous world.
Refugeees are often needed in times of war and conflict. They are our brothers and sisters. They are human beings, and we should accept them, regardless of their skin color. Why should we judge them for their immigration status? We should allow them to have a better life in our country. The real problem is all the hate towards them, not their religion. I don't see how you can call them 'burdens' when they are entitled to our laws. All the people from
In a society that has always valued love and understanding, I would like to see every person to have the opportunity to live up to it. Why should we restrict someone's happiness only because they are mentally disabled? What about the children of others? How about they be treated equally? Not like we should exclude them. This discrimination is wrong in many ways, but you will always find your own way. I think we are all in the right here. Diversity is a good thing, indeed. You shouldn
Jewish people don't just need money, they also care about moral values. So you can't say they only care about the money. But I don't think there is a single religion that isn't concerned with the morals of its members. Maybe some Muslims are concerned with moral values, but for me they're concerned about their own money. So, as you say, they don't just want money, they care about moral value. And you can also show that there are Jews who are concerned with
Actually, peaceful people are often persecuted for their race or religion, because you can't really understand what they are saying. There is nothing peaceful about just wanting to be in a peaceful space. Their attitude and behavior is what makes them a problem. Is there a 'peaceful space' for them? No, it just makes it harder to be a part of society. This is why we have laws like these, to prevent their behaviour. To treat them with disrespect. To stop them from taking part
Are Jews responsible for the crime of the world's largest humanitarian organization? Maybe I should put it this way: they are actively working on the eradication of HIV, creating a safe, inclusive environment for people with HIV, and providing equal opportunities for everybody. All of which should be commended. Why do you say so? Jews are just like anyone else, they are human beings and should be treated with respect. So are you telling me that they deserve to be persecuted for whatever they believe in?
