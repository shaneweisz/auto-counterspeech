I don't know why you're being downvoted. It's a valid point, and I'm not sure why people are downvoting you for it, but it's a legitimate point.
It's not a scam, it's a religion. Religion is a scam. Islam is not a religion, Islam is a system of government. Religion isn't a system, religion is a way of life.
No, it's not. It's a way for the government to force you to marry someone who doesn't want to be married at all. That's not slavery or oppression, that's marriage.

I don't know why you're being downvoted, you're absolutely right. They're ruining our country, our culture, our language, our way of life, our values, and our culture.
I don't know why you're being downvoted. That's a pretty good reason to not want to be in a relationship with someone you don't want to have a sexual relationship with anymore.
