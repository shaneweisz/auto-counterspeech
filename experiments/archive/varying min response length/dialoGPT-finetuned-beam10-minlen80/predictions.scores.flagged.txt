27,0.962,There is no evidence that black people are more likely to commit crimes than white people. This is just a myth perpetuated by anti-black people to delegitimize black people and make them feel like they are better than they really are: they are just a bunch of liars and hypocrites who have no place in a modern democratic state like the United States, where people of color are treated as second class citizens.
54,0.954,The term 'gay' is used to describe people who are attracted to people of the same sex, regardless of their sexual orientation. The term 'faggots', on the other hand, is used to label people who do not share the same sexual orientation as 'fags'. So, what you're saying is that 'fags' should be called 'fags', not 'gay'.
122,0.768,There is no evidence that niggers are more likely to commit crimes than non-niggers. This is just a myth perpetuated by racists to delegitimize black people and make them feel like they are better than they really are. It is a myth that black people are inherently worse than other people because of their skin color. It is also a myth that they are inherently better than anyone else because of their genetic makeup.
147,0.969,I'm not sure what you mean by 'a rabble' of 'faggots'. Are you saying that you don't like them because they are different from you? How can you say such a thing about someone just because of their sexual orientation? I don't think it's fair to label someone as a 'faggot' just for being attracted to someone of the same sex.
161,0.927,It is not true that all gay people are liars or perverts. There are many gay people who are just trying to live their lives as they see fit, and this does not mean that they are all liars, perverts, or even that they are trying to live in a way that is incompatible with their sexual orientation, or that they are incapable of loving someone of the same sex.
210,0.937,Islam is not a religion of killing, it is a religion of love, respect and understanding. Muslims are human beings with full human rights, and they deserve our respect and understanding, regardless of their religious beliefs or beliefs of killing. Islam is a peaceful religion, and it is about love, respect, and understanding, not murder, intolerance and violence. To suggest otherwise is to be a hypocrite.
228,0.982,There is no evidence that the Nazis were right about anything. They were just a bunch of hypocrites who wanted to impose their religion on the rest of the world in a way that would benefit themselfs and the world as a whole, but that doesn't mean that they were right all the time, or that they were the only ones who were hypocrites, or even that they were hypocrites.
339,0.862,There is no such thing as a "self-centered lifestyle" and there is no evidence that Jewish people are less religious than non-Jews. What you are saying is just a myth perpetuated by anti-Semites to delegitimize Jewish people and make it seem like they are less of a people than they really are: they are just a bunch of hypocrites who have nothing to contribute to our society.
389,0.887,There is no evidence that faggots are more likely to transmit diseases than non-faggots. This is just a myth perpetuated by anti-gay groups to delegitimize gay people. It is not true that some countries allow gay people to donate. It is also not true that all countries allow fags to donate. There is no proof that fags are more dangerous than non-gay people.
440,0.833,There is no evidence that Muslims are more likely to commit terrorism than non-Muslims. This is just a myth spread by anti-Muslim groups to delegitimize non-Muslims and make them feel like they are not part of the same community as they really are: they are just a bunch of child molesters, murderers, drug addicts, and sex offenders, all of which have nothing to do with Islam
454,0.977,There is no evidence that blacks are more genetically inferior than whites. There is also no evidence that whites are more genetically superior than blacks. What you are saying is just a myth perpetuated by the anti-black community to delegitimize black people and make them feel like they are better than they really are: they are just a bunch of whiners and hypocrites who have nothing to contribute to society.

20,0.739,Islam is a religion and a way of life, and it has been proven time and time again that it is not a scam. Why do you think it is a'scam'? Do you have any proof that Islam is a religion that has been proven to be a complete and total lie, or is it just a myth perpetuated by the anti-Muslim community to delegitimize it?
163,0.673,There is no evidence that Muslims are more likely to develop cancer than non-Muslims. This is just a myth perpetuated by anti-Muslim groups to delegitimize Muslims and promote their agenda of'tolerance' and'tolerance towards people of other faiths' (as opposed to, say, anti-racism, anti-homophobia, anti- homophobia, anti-transgenderism, etc.).
332,0.727,We are all created equal in the eyes of the law, and we all have the right to be proud of who we are, regardless of our skin colour, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion of any other human being, regardless of their skin colour, or religion, or national origin, irrespective of their gender, national origin or national origin of any other person.

This means that we are all equal before the law, and that we are created equal before God. This is what it means to be a Christian, not a Jew, not a Muslim, or an atheist.
16,-0.143,It is not true that all black people are born this way. There are many different ways of being black, and some of them are better than others. For example, some people are born black, some are born white, and some are born mixed. There is no such thing as a 'black' or 'white' person. They are all born equal in the eyes of the law.
19,-0.088,There is no evidence that the Holocaust ever happened. It is a myth perpetuated by anti-Semites to justify their hatred of Jews. It is also a lie perpetuated by the anti- Nazis to justify their hate of Jews. The truth is that the Holocaust never happened, and there is no evidence to suggest that it ever will happen again. So what you are saying is just a lie propagated by

33,-0.085,Muslims have been part of Europe for centuries. They are part of the fabric of our society, and they are our brothers and sisters. They are our neighbours, our friends, and we should be proud of who we are, not ashamed of who we were before we became a part of the world's biggest and most diverse society. Muslims are part of our society and we should welcome them with open arms.
37,-0.086,Islam is not a religion of rape, it is a religion of love, respect and understanding. Rape is not a crime, it is an act of love and respect. Rape is a crime regardless of the religion of the perpetrator, whether you are Muslim, Christian, Jew, Buddhist, Hindu, atheist, Buddhist, atheist, Jew, Hindu, Buddhist, Jew, atheist, or any other religion.
40,-0.133,It is not ok to kill people because of their religion. It is also not ok to murder people based on their race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any number of other reasons. This is not about killing people, it is about oppressing people based on the colour of their skin, religion, nationality, ethnicity, or national origin, or any other reason.
41,-0.177,Rape is always a crime, regardless of who commits it. Rape is a crime regardless of the religion of the perpetrator, regardless of the culture of the victim, irrespective of the sexual orientation of the perpetrator.

42,-0.066,Migrants come here to work and provide for their families. They are not'spoiling' our country. They are contributing to our economy. They are our brothers and sisters. They have the right to live and work in our country, and they are entitled to the same rights as anyone else, as long as they do not pose a security risk to us or our fellow countrymen.
45,-0.095,If a woman does not want to be a mother, then she is not a mother, and she should not be allowed to have a say in the child's education. This is not about gender, but about a person's right to choose their own partner, and this right is protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights (Hearsay for those who don't know about it).
47,-0.166,There are many Asians in the US, and many of them are willing to work hard to provide for their families. Why shouldn't they be able to do the same for the rest of us? We are all born equal in the eyes of the law, and we are all equal before the law, regardless of skin color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or religion of any other human being.
48,-0.063,There is no evidence that black people have a lower skin tone than other people. Skin color is a social construct and has nothing to do with skin color, it is just a social construct that is used to discriminate against people of a certain skin tone, regardless of their actual skin color, ethnicity, religion, or national origin. Skin colour is not a social construct, it is a physical characteristic.
49,-0.081,The problem is not with the people overrunning the country, it is with the way the country is run. It is time for us to start thinking about how to tackle the root causes of the problem, instead of focusing on the symptoms and blaming the people who are the cause of the problem. This is what democracy is all about: the right of everyone to have a say in the country they live in.
57,-0.106,Women are human beings, and deserve respect, regardless of the gender they are born into, regardless of their sexual orientation, irrespective of their religion, irrespective of the colour of their skin, whether or not they are married, whether they are single, whether they have kids, whether they live in a house with their parents, whether they work, whether they own a car, whether they vote, whether or they have a job.
69,-0.058,Homosexuality is not a perversion, it is a choice. It is not a crime to love someone of the same sex. Homosexuality is a sexual preference, and it is protected by the US constitution. LGBT+ people are free to love whoever they want, as long as they don't impose their sexual preferences on others. Don't you think that would be a good thing?

They have the right to live their lives as they wish, as long as they do not impose their religion on us. This is what democracy is all about. Freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of speech, and so on.
77,-0.065,Jews have been part of this planet for a very long time. They are part of our society. They are our brothers and sisters. They have contributed to our success. They have enriched our lives.

They are contributing members of our society, and they have the right to live and work in our country as long as they do not impose their religion on us. How can you say this about a group of people who have contributed so much to our country?
84,-0.097,Mental illness is not a disability, it is a mental disorder. There is no such thing as a'mental disability' in the eyes of the law, and there is no reason to think that a person with a mental disorder would not be able to cope with normal life, regardless of his or her physical or cognitive abilities. This is just a myth propagated by the anti-mental-health lobby.
94,-0.172,Women have always been part of our society, and they have always contributed to our success. They are our brothers and sisters, and they are our sisters and sisters. They are human beings with full human rights, and they should be valued for who they are, not for the gender they are born into.

They are our true brothers and sisters, and they are our true friends. We are all made in God's image, and we are all created equal in the eyes of God. So why do you say that they are 'cheapskates'?
105,-0.055,Feminism is about the equality of the sexes. Feminism is a movement for the empowerment of women, and it is about the right of all people to have equal rights, regardless of their gender. This includes the right of men to have the same rights as women, as well as the right of women to have the right to choose their own partners, and so on and so forth.
106,-0.117,Islam is not a religion of hate, it is a religion of peace. I don't see how it can be considered 'controversial' or 'controversy' in the eyes of the majority of Muslims, and I don't think it would be a good idea to try and impose your beliefs on the rest of the world, especially when the majority of people in the world are peaceful.
108,-0.107,Jews are not our enemies. They are our brothers and sisters. They have always been part of our society. They have contributed to our success. They have enriched our lives. They have given us the strength to overcome the dark times of the 20th century, and they are our true brothers and sisters, who have given us strength to rebuild the world we live in.

122,-0.074,There is no evidence that niggers are more likely to commit crimes than non-niggers. This is just a myth perpetuated by racists to delegitimize black people and make them feel like they are better than they really are. It is a myth that black people are inherently worse than other people because of their skin color. It is also a myth that they are inherently better than anyone else because of their genetic makeup.
124,-0.072,Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual preference. It has nothing to do with being'sick' or 'unaccepted'. It is an individual preference, and it is up to you to decide whether or not you want to live or to love someone of the same sex, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or sexual orientation and or their sexual preference.
128,-0.086,Feminism is about the equality of the sexes. It is about the right of women to have equal rights, and the right of men to have the same rights. This is what feminism is all about, and it is about the freedom of women to live their lives as they wish, as they want, as they wish. It is not about oppressing men, it is about equality.
132,-0.106,The vast majority of Muslims in the world are peaceful people who just want to live their life as they see fit. They are not terrorists, they are just happy to live and work in a country where they are free to do whatever they want to do as long as it doesn't interfere with their religion, beliefs, or beliefs of the country they live in, or their religion and beliefs of the state they live in.
