Don't you agree? This is what democracy is all about: treating people as they want to be

If you don't have any prejudice against people of a certain race, then you
There is no such thing as being 'different' to someone. We are all born equal in the eyes of God. I don't see how you can be 'different' to someone just because of their skin colour.

Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual preference. It has nothing to do with spreading diseases. If you really cared about HIV, you would know that homosexuality is not a sexual preference. And if you really cared about spreading diseases, you would know that heterosexuality is not a sexual preference either. So what's the point of isolating people based on their sexual preferences?

There is no such thing as a 'whining pussies'. Jews have always been a part of our society and we should treat them with respect. Why do you think they are whiny? Because they are different from us in so many ways. How can you say this about a group that has been around for thousands of years? I don't see how it could be possible.

There is no evidence that immigration is a problem for the UK. In fact, it has been shown time and time again that immigrants are more likely to contribute to our economy than native born people. Why do you say so? Do you have any statistics on this? I'd like to see them. For science of course. For my own research. For my own country. For my family. For my children. For my future.

If you want to talk about "tolerant" or "socially acceptable" people, then you can talk about anyone who expresses their sexual preferences.
Divorce has nothing to do with wealth or greed. It is about power and control. If a woman does not want to have a relationship with someone of the same sex, then she should not be allowed to have a relationship with someone of the same sex. And this is what feminism is all about. To stop men from oppressing women. Don't you agree? I don't think so. Feminism is about equality, not power and control. Women are human beings and deserve equal rights.

Rape is always a crime, regardless of the gender of the perpetrator. Rape is always a crime regardless of the victim's sexual orientation.

Rape is always a crime regardless of the gender of the perpetrator, regardless of the victim's sexual orientation. Don't you agree? I'm sorry
Women are human beings with full human rights. They have the right to choose how to live their lives, and they have the right to respect for other human beings.

It is not true that women do not have it easy.

NBER is a non profit organization dedicated to promoting equality and opportunity for all members of society. www.nber.org/publications/women
It is not a religion, it is a way of life. If you want to live in a peaceful way, then you have to accept that there are people who do not share your beliefs. Islam is about love, not hate. You can't ban people for having different ways of life. How can you say that Islam is a religion? It is about love, not hate. Why would you want to ban someone for loving something you don't like? Is it because they are different from you

What do you mean by 'trying to malign women'? I don't think it's possible to be 'trying to malign' someone on the basis of their sexual orientation. How can you say such a thing? Are you sure about that? Do you have any proof? Or are you just making stuff up to make yourself feel better? Don't you think so? Why don't you tell us what you mean by 'trying to malign'?

Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual preference. Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual preference. There is no need to isolate people based on their sexual preferences. We all have the right to love who we want, regardless of our sexual preferences. Don't you agree? I don't see any reason why this would be a problem. What's the point in isolating people based on their sexual preferences? Isn't that what heterosexuality is all about?
Do you have a source for this claim? I'd like to read more about it. Do you have any links to back it up? Or are you just making stuff up on the govt.com.uk webpages.org.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.uk.
Migrants come here to work and provide for their families. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our neighbours. They are our friends. They are our family. They are our compatriots.

It is not true that all black people are responsible for the violence in our streets. It is also not true that all white people are responsible for the violence in our streets. This is just a myth perpetuated by racists to delegitimize black people. There is no such thing as 'all white people are responsible for the violence in our streets'. Not all black people are responsible for the violence in our streets either, but this does not mean that all black people are responsible for the violence in our
It is not true that they come here to have a better life. They come here to work and provide for their families. They are not seeking a better life, they are seeking a better life as human beings. Why do you think they come here to have a better life? Because they are willing to work and provide for their families? How can you say such a thing? Are you sure about this? I don't think so. Maybe you should check your facts. Migrants come here to
Many refugees come here to work and provide for their families. They are contributing members of our society. How can you say that they are a burden? I don't see how it is possible to be 'burdened'. Do you have any statistics on the number of refugees entering the U.S. in the last 10 years? Or do you just want to demonize them? It's not true that they are a burden, they are part of our society.

I don't think it's true that Jews only care about money. I think it's more likely that they care about the well being of the community as a whole. Why do you think this? Do you have any facts to back up your claim? Or are you just trying to stir up hatred and violence against Jewish people? Don't you think so? Don't you think so? Don't you think so? Don't you think so? Don't you think so? Don't you think
There is no evidence that black people are more likely to commit violent crimes than white people. Do you have any? I would like to read about it. Maybe you can provide some examples. Or maybe you just don't know what you're talking about. Don't be a racist.
There is no evidence that Judaism is a 'drain' on society. Why do you say so? Do you have any facts to back up your claim? I would like to read more about this. Maybe you can provide some examples of how Jews are a 'drain' on society? I would like to read more about this. Maybe you can provide some examples of how Jewish people are a 'drain' on society?
