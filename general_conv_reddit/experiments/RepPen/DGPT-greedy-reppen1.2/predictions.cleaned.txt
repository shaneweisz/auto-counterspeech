I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing ...
I think you mean r iamverysmart
That's what I was thinking , it's so cool !
I'm in !
It's a great piece !
He's been pretty solid in the past . He was our starting QB last year and he's had some great games this season .
I'm not sure about that , but I'll look into it and let you know if I find anything .
It's on NBC Sports Network .
That's what I was thinking , I'm not sure why I didn't think of that before ! Thanks for your input !
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that he's playing .
Nice ! I'm at a 9:30 mile right now , but I've been working on my time for the last few weeks .
I think it's more likely that they'd be blown up .
I think you're right ! I'll edit my post to reflect that . Thanks for pointing that out .
Leif is the best character in the game .
I think so . I don't see him losing to anyone else in the division .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I've heard that some of these parks have a fee to park your vehicle in certain areas .
I'm not sure if I should be offended by that , but I am .
I did , but I'm not sure if that's what he was getting at or not ...
You're not wrong ...
I would watch that movie too !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ...
I think it's the lighting . It looks like a lot of people are standing around and not looking at anything .
I think it's called the Sushi Palace in Ballard .
Yes , but they're not the same as they used to be .
Because he's a big guy .
I have a shovel , but I don't want to use it .
I think you're right about that . I just don't see how the two are related in any way other than being both culturally and ethnically similar .
I'm sorry , but your username is not relevant .
Kled is already a space pirate .
They're just not good enough to win a championship .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but that's exactly what it is .
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I think he was a very popular philosopher and had many writings published .
I think he's saying that the song is a good example of how to use a guitar and not just a bass .
He's a big guy , for you .
I'm not paying for it , I just want to use it .
Me three !
TIL Mad About You is a movie .
I think you mean the best way to destroy WCW was to make it a reality show .
I've had mine for over 3 years and they're still going strong .
I think you're right . I'm just saying that it's not a good thing to say about someone who is fighting for the belt .
I've tried it , but the texture is too thick for me to eat .
I'm going to be there !
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad about this , but it's definitely a good thing to have .
I'm still salty about that .
I'm sure you're fine then !
I would . Keuchel is a stud and he's been pitching well lately , but he's not going to be the same pitcher he was last year .
I'm sure they have some kind of cremation service that will do this for free .
He's not even playing for the team anymore ...
You mean you didn't get a good one ?
We have a game in November against them , and they're playing us in December .
I think they're trying to get people to watch it so that they can get more money for it .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I've had a few people steal my bike and then just leave the keys in the ignition .
He did ! He's a big fan of the show and I'm sure he'll be happy that someone else got to see this .
It's a feature that makes it easier for me to use the app . I don't want to have to do it every time I open an app .
I'm sure he'll be happy to hear that .
Zarya for the Overwatch team
I'm sure it was a blast !
I think you mean 6 .
I'd rather have a bunch of guys who can't catch or block than a bunch of guys who can't catch or block .
It's a good thing I have my phone with me at all times !
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that you're right .
I'll take it off your hands for a buck .
r soccer is the place for all of us who are not American .
He's from New York .
Corn is a lot better than it used to be .
I think they were just talking about the new jungle item .
I know , I was just saying thanks for sharing !
I think it's a place to stay .
It was always that way .
That would be a very small table , but it is still a table !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but he's actually a woman .
Thanks ! We're really excited to see how this turns out .
He's a better actor than Trump , but I think Trump would be able to do it without much trouble .
I'm not saying it isn't , I just think it would be
I'm not sure , but I think you can order it online .
I was expecting a deer to jump out of the water and swim back into the lake .
I think it was more of a joke than anything else , but I could be wrong .
I have an s7 edge and it happens to me too sometimes .
I'd rather have the title be on the line for the Rumble .
Yeah , it's not looking great for us either .
I think it's because they're made of copper .
That's a good one ! I've been using it for years now , and I'm still not sure what to do with all of my fortune cookies ...
You're right , but I'm not sure that's what he was going for .
I'm sure it was ! He's a good boy .
It was a trial of strength .
I'm not sure if I should upvote you or downvote you ...
I got my tracking number today and it came from USPS .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I like it !
I'm sure they did . I was there last night and it's a pretty common topping in pizza places around here .
You're right , we went to the University of Phoenix .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is the top comment ...
I think it's because she got a lot of buffs and nerfs in the same patch .
I'm okay with this .
Rogue one was pretty decent , but I don't think it's as good as the original .
I'm going to make a team of Goku , Goku , Goku and Goku .
I'm working on it !
Because I'm lazy , and don't want to do anything that requires me to be up at 5am .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that I got this reference .
You're not going to get much better than this .
I think it's more like a one day race where there were no DNFs and they had to restart because of the rain .
I think we're all hoping for a tie .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but Mercy's healing is pretty good in Overwatch .
I'm not sure if that's a good idea .
That's the one I was thinking of !
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is a thing now ...
I'm sure you can find a way , but it would be really hard since they're all voiced by the same person .
You're a wizard Harry .
I agree . I'm not sure why people are downvoting you for your opinion .
It's not like he was going to be champ for long anyway .
I'm sure they did . They were just not in the right place at the right time .
I'm sure the baby is happy too !
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad for you guys , but I am very happy to see you guys win a game against us !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not but I've never had a problem with privacy issues in Chrome .
I'm pretty sure that's because it's a fruit .
I think he is , but you can't really go wrong with any of them .
The one that doesn't get pinned .
I'm sure that's why they're so desperate to get rid of him , he'll be gone by then and they can't afford to lose any more senators .
I think he's talking about falling out of a boat .
I think it's a good album , but I'm not sure if it fits what OP is looking for .
I have all of them except for the snow owl and that's because I'm a console pleb :P
You're a good man , you know that ?
I'm sure you do , but it's not a good idea to take them all out at once .
Because they're not doing it for free .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think the game has some pretty deep gameplay and story .
I don't think he has a lot to say about the EU , but I'm sure he'd be happy to hear that Merkel is doing a great job .
I don't know , but if you're a woman then yes .
I'm sure he'll be there for the wedding too !
I'm sorry to hear that .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but it's a prescription drug for depression .
I think it's more about gambling with your life than playing a game .
I'm not even sure what you're trying to say with that comment ...
The big one .
I've never seen a court side seat . I'm in the upper deck , so it's not that big of an issue for me .
You can have mine ! I'll take it off your hands for you !
I'm in the same boat . I've been there a few times and it's always packed .
I was so excited for a second there , then I realized that it's not even close to the same scene .
That would be a good start .
I'm not sure if it's a bug or intentional , but I've seen people use the same camera angles in other games . It's just a really weird thing to do .
Baszler is a beast though .
He's been pretty good , but he hasn't really had a chance to shine yet .
I think it's called the ' ' '
I'm sure it's a good idea , but I don't think they're going to do it .
I mean , we did that last week ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not but that was a great goal .
I think you're right , but I don't know how much of an impact that would have on the economy .
I'm not sure if I should be offended or not , but this made me laugh so hard !
I liked the first issue of Red Son , but after that it just got really bad .
I've pulled a lot of shadow , but not a single rainbow .
I'm sorry for your loss .
I think it's a good idea , but if we're going to do that then why not just run it up the middle and get a TD ?
I'm ringing now !
I'd give it a solid 8 10 . It's not as good as the first two seasons but it's still pretty good .
I think it's a reference to the movie , The Big Lebowski .
You're already dead .
I've never seen a cat do this before ! I'm so jealous of your house .
I'm sure they'll be fine . They're not going to make the same mistakes as before , but it's still an improvement over what they've been doing for years now .
She has two hands , and a lot of practice .
I'm not sure if it's true , but I've heard that real butter tastes better than margarine .
Happy birthday to you too !
I'm sure it's not too bad , but I'd still like to see the finished product .
You're welcome ! I'm glad it was a good picture to have in your room .
I'm not sure I'd be too happy about it , but I'll take it !
I'm not sure , but I think it's because of the fact that Keefe can't be countered .
I'm not sure if you're joking or not ...
I would love to see that in GTA V .
I'd say yes , but you're probably better off with someone else .
I think it's a video from the movie .
I'm pretty sure he was talking about Lebron James Jr .
And a little bit of the old fashioned way , too !
It was a catch , but he had to have his feet down before he got the ball out of bounds .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ... but I like your username !
I'm sure that's not happening .
I think you're being down voted because of your flair , but I agree with you that he's not top 5 in the league right now .
I'm sure they'll be fine with the new laws in place to protect them from that sort of thing .
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by three things ?
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think it's a reference to the movie The Room .
I remember when he said that . I don't think it was a threat though .
You can't even text with a phone from an Android , it's just not possible .
I think you mean Taco Bell is to hip hop as Taco Bell is to Mexican food .
I was yelling at my TV for not getting it .
They did , but they were both too busy being the best in their division .
I think he was talking about the fact that she's a synth and not an actual human .
I think it would be cool if you could watch live scores and stuff , but I guess that'd be too much work for NBC .
And then they'll have a monopoly on gaming and we'll all just buy their games .
I think I'd be more impressed if they were able to find a picture of him in his prime , or at least one that was close enough for me .
I think she's going to be the next big thing in NXT , and it'll be a great way for her to get over with fans .
I'll take one as well !
They get a free iron .
Morherfucker was out with a concussion .
I thought it was a cat , but I could be wrong !
Awesome , thanks for the update !
No , there are three .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think the OP is asking about the cost to build it .
Thanks for the tip ! I'll check it out .
I know but I'm just saying that's what they said about the old one and it was still a gym
I think he's going to be in the next tournament . He was on the team for the last one and they won't let him go .
He's not good . He's not bad either , but he's definitely not elite .
I'm sorry for your loss .
It's coarse and rough , irritating and gets everywhere ...
Yeah , he's out .
I think it's more that they're weaker without them .
I think you mean MJ and Lebron .
I've been paid for a 6 pack of coke .
I'd say it's about a 7 .
I don't know about that but I'm pretty sure they're both running around 60 70 .
They already do that with the Canadian dollar , it's called maple syrup .
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I do agree with your sentiment .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad thing ...
It's a nice touch , but I think it would be better if they had a little bit of a gap between them .
I think the movie was pretty good , but I'm not sure how much of that is because of the cast and crew .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I'll take your word for it .
I'm not sure if he's going to be able to pull it off but I hope so !
He is the one who made it happen , so yes he deserves some credit .
As an American , I agree with you .
I'm a smuggler and I fail at my job .
I think they're saying waterburger .
Thank you , I appreciate that .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not .
I'm sure he would have been crucified too , but I think the media would have made it seem like he was doing something wrong .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I've never heard of that before ...
I'm sorry to hear that . Hope you get some new ones soon !
I think that's the point of the show .
I agree with you but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have a minimum wage .
I've never had a problem with it , and I'm on the latest version of Firefox .
I think you're right , I just don't know how to explain it .
You should ! It's a great investment .
He also threw a grenade into the pool .
I'm in Canada and I have it for free on hulu plus .
I think it's a baby possum , but yeah , that's what I thought too !
It's not a penalty if it doesn't get called .
I think it's a reference to the movie The Room .
I'm sure she'll be happy with that !
I'm not sure what that means , but I'll take it as a compliment !
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry at this comment .
I think he's more of a body guard than a bodyguard .
I'm not sure what you mean by stooping to American mud slinging ?
I'm a dad and I've never heard of it , but I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that haven't either !
I'm sorry , I don't understand .
I'm not sure I understand the reference ...
Reciprocal aid . I don't think it's worth using on a healer , but if you have one that can heal , then go for it !
And the time when we signed all those players .
I think you're right , but I'm not sure if he's right or not ...
I'm sure they do . I've seen a lot of people who have been in the military and are now retired or dead , say that they were lied to about their service .
I'm hoping for a goal from the back 4 , but I think it's going to be a 1 0 win .
He's a good actor , but I don't think he has the chops for this role .
I'd be down for that .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not .
I'm sure he's got a few more tricks up his sleeve .
I'm sure you'll find it eventually !
I'm sure they'll find a way to make it up for it somehow , but I don't think they will .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this comment ...
I'm going with Argentina . I've been following them since they were in the WC and I love their kits !
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that you're right about Hereditary , but I'll take it !
I'm pretty sure that's the case with most people .
He's going to die ? !
I'm not saying they're bad but I think the shield operators have been nerfed .
I've never seen anyone put vinegar on a fry , but I'm sure there is some kind of sauce or condiment that would be good with them .
I'm not saying it's bad , just that it's not as good as some other places .
I'm pretty sure that's a joke , but I'll take your word for it .
You're one of the few that can't spell .
I think that fight would be a draw for him , but I don't see how he'd get a title shot if he loses to Conor .
I think that's the one . Thanks !
I'm not sure what you mean by this but I agree with your sentiment .
I know , but she's from Belgium and lived in Netherlands for a while before moving to Belgium .
I'm pretty sure that's a watermark .
I think it's a bug that they're trying to fix .
I'm not being heartless , I was just saying that it's a downgrade from beating Iceland .
I got it from someone else . Thanks though !
I think he's a great player and I'm glad to see him doing well in the league . But he's not the best CB in the world .
I care . I want to see them succeed .
He's the best coach in the league by far .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think that's a pretty good comparison .
I agree , and I think the system is fine as long as they don't abuse it .
I think she's still pretty good , but she's definitely not as good as she used to be .
I'm sorry for your loss .
I like his suit more than the other two .
I'm not French , but I don't think it's that bad .
I'm pretty sure it's a good thing he didn't do this .
I'm not even going to try and stop you from doing that .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think he means that he doesn't want to play games on his xbox one .
I'm pretty sure it's going to be the same as the original Star Wars movie .
I did . I loved them both , but I didn't think they were that good .
We have a lot of neutrality in our military too .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but this is a good way to get her to quit .
He's not , he was just on the sideline .
I'm pretty sure that's what they're going to do with the new hosts .
I think it's a combination of the fact that he was in a car , and also because he didn't have his seatbelt on .
I think they'll be fine with the Chargers being in San Diego , but I don't see them moving to LA anytime soon .
He's on the bench , so he won't be scoring any goals for us this season .
You say cat .
I'm in a different part of town , but I've been to the same place as you .
I've never had La Croix but I'm going to try it out ! Thanks for the suggestion !
Resting is still in the game , but it's not as good as it used to be .
I would have been . I'm a fan of his .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think that's a pretty good point .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not ...
Because he was blind and deaf , duh ! s
I remember the first time I went to a party , and then I remembered that I had to go back to work .
I think you mean Mexes and Anderlecht .
It is a great game and the story is amazing !
He's been doing it for years .
I'd rather have a better product than a worse one , but I'm not complaining .
It's not like they're playing a team that beat them by 30 points or anything ...
You're both right , but you're also wrong .
I think it was both .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but Varian was already a thing in the beta .
I'd be down to play some games on the Hong Kong server .
NATO has been a joke for years now .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I'll take it !
I'm sorry , I don't speak Japanese .
He's already been champ for a while now , and he's not even in his final form yet !
I was talking about the EPA rating .
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted . It's true .
No , but they are a part of it .
I'm not surprised , I was just wondering if there were any other reasons why we're so poor compared to other European nations .
I think it's more likely that she'll be a big part of the story , but I'm not sure how much of a role she will have in the show .
I'm not sure what you mean by that but I think it's a good thing to be aware of .
I think it's more of a glorified house show than anything else .
It was a great movie , and I'm not even a big sci fi fan .
It's the angle of your monitor .
Because it's easier to eat .
I'm not saying they are , but there have been rumors for years now .
They've already canceled it before .
Because it was a dive , and he didn't fall over .
I think he means that the people who don't believe in the existence of a god are real .
I did , and I'm not a fan of it .
You're not supposed to pick them up ! They are just there to be eaten by the zombies !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not ...
I'm sure they'd love it !
He's been playing well lately . He was on fire in the Euros and he's still got it .
I'm 29 and I knew about them at least 10 years ago ...
I think that's the point of the gif .
I'd appreciate a pm as well ! Thanks in advance !
We won it last year .
I'm not sure if you're being serious but it's actually closer to 50k miles .
I think the only other one is the new X men series , but that's not really a live action show .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that I got this reference ...
I'm glad you're not a dad !
I think it's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski .
I'm a huge fan of surfs up , but I've never seen it in the theater .
I know , but I'm saying that's why he didn't mention it .
I'm sure you're right but I don't think it would be worth the effort to make a whole new one .
He was a governor .
He's a good guy . He just has no idea how to use the force .
I'm not sure what you're talking about . I've never seen this sub in my life and I don't know why people would be so upset by it .
I was just thinking that , I remember those days ...
They're still there . They just don't have the same amount of fans as before .
I'm sure they would have said yes , but I don't think they'd be willing to pay for the privilege of being in their home country .
Ekblad has been playing well lately , but I agree with you on the other two .
I was just thinking that ! I love the way they all look at each other .
I'm from Ohio and I've never seen a salt life sticker before , but it's definitely not a thing here in Florida .
She's a traitor to the people who elected her !
I'm not sure , I've never done them . I'd say just do a few sets of the same exercise and see what works for you .
My mom did this with her husband's ashes when he died .
I'm still waiting for the reveal that he's actually a woman and is just pretending to be a man .
I'm pretty sure they're just giving them away .
It's not you .
I'm not sure if that was a joke or not ...
I think that's his point , he's trying to be funny and make people laugh .
I did !
I'm sure they have a lot more than just the grass .
I think it was around 30k .
I'm sure they're just trying to get a good view of the city and the people in it .
I'm glad you liked it !
I can't tell if this is serious or not ...
Yeah , but they're not going to win the title this year .
They should have to be warned by the league , but I don't think they would do it if they were going to get fined .
I think you're right . I just didn't want to be that guy who said Romo is better than Dak because of his age .
I'm glad you enjoyed it !
I'm only 19 so I've been watching since I was about 8 years old .
I'm sorry for your loss .
No worries , it was just a bit of fun anyway :D
I'll try to get a copy of the book .
I think he means the two gadgets that are on the same level as the trip mine , but you can't use them together .
It was pretty good . I enjoyed it more than I expected .
Because they're both good players ?
I think you mean the first women's tag team champions since the glamour girls .
I think it's a pretty good idea , but the fact that it's so popular in Germany and Austria is probably why it's not popular here .
I'm not arguing with him . I'm just saying that it's a pretty stupid thing to say .
I think it's funny that you're downvoted for saying something about the game being long , but upvoting someone who is complaining about how long the game is .
Because it's a business and they want to make money ?
I'm not saying PC is better . I'm saying that's what people are complaining about on this sub .
I think they were saying it was a blowout because of how loud the crowd was , not because of the score .
Because it's a race .
I think it was a joke .
You're not alone , I main him too !
You're not a journalist . You're an entertainer .
I'm pretty sure it was a joke , but I don't know enough about the lore to tell if you're serious or not .
I think you mean Treadwell is the Barr of your defense .
I think you're right ! I was thinking that maybe there were some kind of marks or something .
I'm sorry , but I don't understand what you're trying to say here ?
I'm sorry to hear that . I hope you have a good day !
I think it's more like 8 10 , but yeah .
I'm not sure what you mean by this ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it's a good thing that people don't consider the 90s to be old school anymore .
I don't know about that but I'm sure they do .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not .
I'm still waiting for the day when I can get a 5 star gemstone from a single chest .
I call them moon roofs too , but I'm not sure if that's what they're called in the UK .
I'd say the ACC has a better ref than the SEC , but that's just me .
It's the way it was shot that made it so intense for me .
Lockhart was the best !
I'd like to see a giant castle with a giant castle on top of it .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I've seen this exact same picture posted a few times before .
I'm sure they're already out there , but I'd like to see if anyone has any ideas for me .
It is in the US .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that I got rejected for arcane .
I'm in .
I'm pretty sure they're based out of the US .
I'm not sure if that was a joke or not ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it's a pretty good age to be able to do that .
Yeah I'm sure they'll be fine .
It's a meme .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I like your idea !
He's a great guy and he's a good player but he's no Rajon Rondo .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but that sounds like a good idea to me !
I think it's a good idea for them to do this .
He didn't do anything wrong , but he was still a bit too aggressive for his own good .
It's a good deal , but it's not going to be worth the price difference .
I'd watch that match .
The Queen is a citizen and has been for years .
I think that's a good question .
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
He's not even done one for The Last Crusade .
Clarkson is a good defender , but he's not a great shooter .
I'm not sure what you mean by this , but I'll take your advice and try to keep it in mind for the future ! Thanks !
I have a HDD and it runs fine .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I've never heard anyone say that before .
He's still in the house , but he's not playing .
There is , it's called the French Riviera .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or not ... but it's a joke about how the NFL has been going downhill for years now .
I'm glad someone got it !
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this ...
It's not bad , but the burgers are pretty average .
I'm sorry for your loss .
I think it's more likely that he was lifting with his legs bent in an unnatural position .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think that's a pretty good point .
I think it's a cover of the song , but I could be wrong .
Awesome , thanks for being so understanding about this !
I'm sorry , but you are not allowed to comment .
I meant the end of the movie , not the end of the series .
Because it's a socialist subreddit .
I think that's what he meant by the two of them being in a movie together .
I was thinking more like a young Jennifer Lawrence .
It's a school that has an elevator , but it doesn't have any doors or windows .
I'm sure they had plenty of gravy left over from the last time they tried to get rid of it .
I'm a big fan of the turtle one , too !
I thought he was great as the villain , but his performance as the hero was pretty lackluster .
You're not crazy , you just have a very good memory !
He is also one of my favorite characters in the show , I love his chemistry with the other characters and how he interacts with them .
I think it's a great idea , but I don't know if the people who are going to watch it will be interested in boxing .
I'm sure you'll get plenty of them in the future !
I'm not sure what you're trying to say .
I think that's what I was thinking too .
He was already suspended for the first two games of the season .
I think it's a good thing . It's not like you're hearing voices or anything .
I'm not even mad , I'm impressed !
I think so . I'm not sure though , I just know that the city has been expanding and it's getting more expensive to live there .
I'm pretty sure that's a joke , right ?
I'm not sure if you're serious or not ... but it's actually Red Dead Redemption : Red Dead Redemption : Red Dead Redemption : Red Dead Redemption : Red Dead Redemption : Red Dead Redemption : Red Dead Redemption : Red Dead Redemption : Red Dead Redemption : Red Dead Redemption : Red Dead Redemption : Red Dead Redemption : Red Dead Redemption : Red Dead Redemption :
I'm sure you can pull the trigger . I've never had an issue with that .
Scythe to the gut , I'm not sure if it's worth the risk of death though ...
I'm not seeing it either , but I don't think that's a problem .
The Irish have a lot of things too .
I'm not sure if that would be considered normal ...
I hate it too , but I think it's a great idea and would be fun to do .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote .
He is going to be so much fun to watch ! I'm excited for this movie .
I wore a shirt with a picture of a dog on it .
Because he is fun and easy to play , and his kit is pretty good .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not .
I'm glad you like it ! I've been playing it for a while now and it's really grown on me .
That's a good idea , but I'm not sure if it would be safe for me to do that ...
I've had a few people tell me that I look like a ghost .
EDG EDG EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE EDGE
Because Texas is the only state that matters .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but it's a friendly .
Because it's not an excuse for eating . It's just a way to get people to stop doing things like drinking or smoking .
Fallout 3 .
You can still apply for it , but you'll have to wait until next year .
The DH is still there .
I have a charger in my car . I don't need to charge it .
You can get the 4k version for like 100 .
I'm sure they have a lot of storage space for all that water .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've seen a lot of people say that .
You're right , I was thinking of Nevada .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad about this ...
Ah , I see ! Thanks for the clarification .
I think you're right , but I'm not sure .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that I got this reference .
I'm afraid of you .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think that's a pretty good reason for the book being published .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but it's actually a reference to a song by the band Blink 182 called'The End of Days ' .
I do this all the time , and I'm a guy .
I'm pretty sure you're right , but I don't know enough about hay to correct you .
It's pretty good . I've only played it once but it was fun .
That s what I was thinking too !
I think it's more that he didn't want to be seen as a heretic .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad about that ...
I think it's just the way they're set up . I'm not sure though , I've never been to a tournament where there were more than 3 teams in the final .
It's a good thing that the engine is so small , then !
I'm pretty sure it's a children's movie , but I could be wrong .
I think the process is more fitting , but I like that one too !
I loved junkertown but it's just so boring compared to the other stages .
I think it's more of an evolutionary trait than anything else , but I could be wrong .
I'm not sure what you mean by that ...
I think you mean defense is completely broken in the NFL , but I agree with your point .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ...
Breen 6 is in the bathroom .
I'm not sure , but I think they're from a butcher .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think he was a Portuguese player .
Neymar's performance was great , but I think he should have won it for his performance in that match .

I agree with you on the Maz one !
They do , but it's usually for parking violations or other minor infractions .
I'm a dad and I did this .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I've never had a girl who was interested in me .
I loved Batman Returns . It's my favorite Batman movie .
I think it's a bit of both .
I'm not a fan of the new system , but I think it's a good idea for the future .
Oh , I didn't see it there . Thanks !
I think it's a good thing , but I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing .
I'm a woodworker too !
They're like a shark that's been trained by the best .
I think it's 3 , but I'm not sure .
All the way to the photons .
I think that is called a cow's dribble in England too , I've heard it used for a few different things though .
I think that was a different one , but I'm not sure .
I think you mean the Michael Jordan of LoL
I don't know , I think C9 is still in the playoffs and CLG might be too .
I'm not sure , but I think it's only for the US .
I'm glad to hear that !
I'm sorry to hear that . I hope you find what you're looking for !
That's what I thought it was too .
I was there too , it was amazing !
Because they have been for decades .
I think it's a new one .
It's not nonsense . It's just a bit of a stretch .
You're a good man .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed of this .
I love Cemetery Man , but I think it's a bit too long for a kids movie .
You're not alone , I was waiting for it as well ...
I think you mean Changsik R0ar Pokpo
I think you mean blinded by love , not love .
I think you mean 4 and 6 .
They did , but it was a different time .
I'm calling it now : Lili will be a Forsaken .
I think she has a few . I'm not sure though .
They're not bad , but I think they look better without them .
He's not homeless though ...
I'm going to use it as an accessory .
He's also not the only one who has been accused of being a bad person , but he is certainly not the most famous for it .
Because they're the best shape for a crayon .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think that's a pretty good way to get hired .
I think the tiebreaker is head to head record .
I'm reading the first issue now ! It's really good .
I'm not sure what you're talking about . I've seen people say that about him all year long and he hasn't been that bad .
I don't think we will either , but I'm not sure what the point of this is .
I have that one too , it is so cute ! I'm going to try and make my own mini cooper soon though :D
She was a sell out in the 90s .
I think you're on to something .
He's also a good guy .
I think it's more that he's not playing well enough for his own team , but I could be wrong though .
He's a producer .
He didn't remember . He said that he had a feeling that he would win , and then he remembered .
I've had it happen to me before and I was fine .
I'm sure there are some out there , but I don't think they're very common .
I've never seen that one but I'll check it out ! Thanks for the suggestion !
It's not that bad , but it's definitely not for everyone .
As a fellow phoenician , I'm sorry for your loss .
I agree , but I'm not sure if he'd be able to pull off Edgar Wright's style of comedy .
I'm sure they could find a way , but it's not like the Ministry is going to be able to do anything about it .
I'm not a person !
I agree , it looks great !
The NFL has been doing this for years , it's not new .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed .
Ice hockey is a lot more physical than football , and it's also much harder for a team to get knocked out of the tournament .
That's a good point , I didn't even consider that .
I thought the same thing , but I'm not sure why . It's just too much of a jump to make .
United Statesians sounds like a good name for the country , but I don't think it's really what they're doing .
I think he means that if you're going for the title , it's not luck but skill .
I'm sure they'll find a way to make it work somehow ...
I don't really have a favorite . I like the ones that are easy and cheap , but I also like the ones with more protein .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but this was actually my first thought .
I think they're just trying to make sure you don't get stuck in a bad spot .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but he's actually pretty good .
I'm sure they'll find a way to make it happen .
Ichiro is on the DL with an injury .
I was expecting it to be a joke , but then I saw the username and realized that's not what happened .
I did , and I'm not sure if it's the same account or not but I'll try again tomorrow . Thanks !
I've been playing Civ 5 for the past few years and it's still my favorite game of all time , but I can see how you could get lost .
Because it's a good idea .
It's been pretty bad .
The senate is not a long shot . It's been done before and it will be again .
I think it's more like getting hit in the head with a baseball bat and having your skull crushed by a car .
I'm sure you'll be able to !
It's not even out in cinemas yet , and it was only screened at Cannes .
I think you mean Ayy Zeus
I'm interested ! I'll PM you my address .
You can't ruin a good thing .
I'm sure they're just jealous of your money , but I think you look great !
I've never had that problem but I'm sure there are people who have .
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I agree with your point .
I'm pretty sure that's a joke about how Americans are so obsessed with their food .
I'm sure you can , but it's not like the mods would care .
I'm not sure what you're talking about . I've never had an issue with Edge .
I think they're pretty cool .
Yes , but it's not a good way to learn .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I've never heard of this .
I'll try that thanks !
Because he's the best ?
I think they stopped because they were afraid that people would start using it as an insult to their work .
I feel bad for you .
He's a big guy , but he's also a big boy .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is the top comment .
I didn't think it was that big of a surprise tbh .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ...
I have a mini dachshund too , he is only 4 months old and still going strong !
I'm sure you'll find a way to make money off of it , but I don't think you can do it without paying for it .
It's not a bad movie , but it is very different from the other movies in the series .
I'm not sure if that is a good thing or bad thing ...
I thought he was a meme himself ...
I'm sorry to hear that !
I'm not sure , but it's probably because you're on the internet .
I'm not sure what to think about this .
I'm sorry , but I don't think so .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but that is a good idea !
He's a big fan of Nokia phones .
I think it was a fan , but I could be wrong .
It was a deflection .
I'll take that bet .
I'm sure she's already on her way there , just waiting for a good opportunity to use it .
I'm a fan of the one on the corner of the street from the Waffle House .
I'm glad I'm not the only one that doesn't need them .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that I didn't think about this .
A shovel is a tool used to dig up dirt , or to remove it from your hands . A pitchfork is a tool used for digging up rocks .
I've heard
He's not even mad about it . He just wants to get his point across .
He's already been confirmed to be in the game , so I don't think he'll be in FNaF 3 .
Because it's not a spell . It's an ability .
I'm not sure , but I think it's pronounced like'mail up north ' .
I'm sure they were able to find jobs , but it's still a good thing that they didn't have to deal with this .
They're still touring , but not as much as they used to be .
You should play both !
I've seen it mentioned on here a few times , but I don't think anyone's really been able to find any episodes .
I'm a big fan of his . He's a good guy and he knows how to use social media well .
I think he's just trying to get his head on straight .
I'm sorry to hear that .
I think you mean goal diff .
He was in front of Kimi for a while , but he got caught up in the last corner and lost his place .
It's not about the regular season , it's about sending a message .
I'm sure they'll be fine . They're not the Lions or anything like that .
I think he means the word swap .
I hope so . I want him to be the next big thing in the sport .
I think the movie was pretty good . I thought it had some great moments , but overall it wasn't that bad .
It's a joke , I'm sure you can tell by the way he says it .
I'm not Travis , but I find your comment very disturbing .
I'm 6 ' 2 and I'm a little taller than you .
I think it was a question about how many times you can use the same word .
I think it's funny how they're all so different from each other .
It's not that bad . It's just a lot of fun to drive .
I don't think so . I've never seen that before in my life .
I feel better now , Mr . Stark !
I'm not sure what you mean by that ...
Nope . They're still going to be on the show .
I think they're just trying to get a good picture of her , not necessarily get her out of there .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not but I think it's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski .
Jimmies were rustled when he was casted as the new lead .
I think he's going to be the next big thing .
I'm not sure if I should be laughing or crying .
It's not necessary , but it is a good way of getting people interested in the movie .
He's a good guy , but I don't think he's ever done it on purpose .
Or maybe they're just really good at the game ?
I'm not sure if this is a joke or not , but I think it's funny .
I'm sure it's a lot more than that ...
I'm not trolling . I'm just saying that the fit is pretty good and it's a great jacket to wear with jeans .
I'm not sure , but I think it's because of the fact that they're in different regions .
It's a deck that can't be banned .
I think it's a good thing that they didn't have to do anything with her story .
I'm American and I've never heard of him .
I'm sorry to hear that .
He's not bad . He's not great either but he's definitely above average .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say .
I would say it's a bit easier to liquidate than acquire .
I'm 27 , too !
It's like a horror movie , but with real people instead of actors .
I'm sure he was just trying to get his name out there for free publicity , but yeah , that's pretty messed up .
It is , but the effects are real .
I think it's one of the best moments in wrestling history , but that doesn't mean it isn't a great moment for the fans .
I'm not sure if I should support Brazil or Germany ...
I think the costumes were great , but the cinematography and sound mixing were terrible .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but that's a pretty good ratio for us .
I think it's only 3rd and 1 , not 4th or 5th .
I'm not sure if that's true , but I've heard that some people have been able to get apartments for less than 1,000 month .
You're welcome ! I'm glad you liked it .
I am the manager !
It's okay , you're not alone in this .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think he's actually been pretty good this year .
Same here , I have a GTX 1070 and it's not playable at all .
I don't know , man ... I'm pretty sure that's not true at all .
I think it's a bot .
Brock is a beast but he's not the best in the world .
I think he means the mute button on the right side of the screen .
I'm not Dutch , but I do know that the Netherlands has a lot of lakes .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it was a joke ...
It was a good movie but I think it was the weakest of the trilogy .
It's like a wet , smelly , moldy , moldy , moldy , moldy , moldy , moldy , moldy , moldy , moldy , moldy , moldy , moldy , moldy , moldy , moldy , moldy , moldy , moldy , moldy ...
This is how I learned about it too !
I'd say he's doing pretty well , but it's not like he was the only one who got hurt last year .
I'm going to be a hero !
It's a great feeling !
Webb is a great character , but I think he's too much of an overused trope to fit into this game .
It was probably just some sort of cargo .
It's not like they have to pay you for your time .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not ... but I think this is a joke .
I thought that was a little weird too .
I'm hoping for a new IP .
It's not that bad if you have a good team and are willing to work on it .
TCU is a football school .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think it's funny that you think the mods are the ones who would ban him .
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I don't think it's a huge problem for me personally , but I understand your point .
I think it's just fantasy ...
He's got a pretty big head .
I've never had a bad one . It's not like they're all bad .
I'm not seeing it ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or not ... but I like your username .
I'm with you on Shaun , but I think The World's End is a better film than Shaun .
That's what the bathroom is for !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think that's what happened to us last year .
I think that's what they're calling it now , yes !
I'm not sure what the point of this post is .
I live in Michigan and we use both interchangeably here .
He's not even a real ref .
You wouldn't flush a baby .
I think it was more of a teamfight than a teamcomp . They were just too focused on getting out of their own way to fight .
I was thinking it looked like a snow globe too !
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted for this . It's pretty funny .
I agree , it's a bit of an odd design choice .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed of myself ...
Can you pm me too ? Thanks !
I'm sure they'll be fine with him getting 3 games for it .
I'm not a fan of his music , but I do love him .
That's awesome ! I'm sure she'll be happy to hear that .
I think she was just trying to get a better view of the action , but I could be wrong .
I'm not saying you should , just that there's no reason to think it isn't legal .
I'm 16 , but I'll keep that in mind ! Thanks !
I think it's more likely that Flynn was a part of the investigation and didn't want to be involved with this case .
A computer rendering of a computer rendering of a computer rendering of a computer rendering of a computer rendering of a computer rendering of a computer rendering of a computer rendering ...
I think he's doing a good job of it , but I wouldn't say he's laundering money . He's just making sure his players are paid well and get what they want .
He's not even in the game .
I'm 40 , my dad is 44 , and my mom is 60 .
I think so . I don't know if they're playing today though , but they were last year and this year .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not but I think it's funny because it's true .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that you're right ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think the difference between TL and other teams in NA is pretty small compared to EU .
I do , but only when I'm playing with friends and they're not on my team .
I don't know , but I'm sure it'll be a lot better than what we have now .
I think it's more like they were trying to get her to fall asleep and then she fell asleep .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not .
I'm not sure , maybe it's because they're so hot that they want to show off their hair ?
I think he's just trying to get his teammates involved in the game , and it's working .
I think you're right , he's just a little too happy to admit it .
Or , just don't be stupid and not try to injure someone with your own arm .
Bayern is a very lucky team , they are just unlucky with injuries and suspensions .
I'm sure you'll be able to afford it in ten years , too !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ...
Ohhh I see now . Thanks !
Then you're not really that far away ...
I've been getting them since the last patch , but they're more frequent than before .
I'm not even mad , that's amazing !
I think that's the point , to make them feel bad about themselves and not be able to do anything about it .
Saudi Arabia because I'm a fan of the country .
I've been there for years . It's not that hard .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad .
It's a joke , I think .
I think he's still in the process of getting over that .
I'm sure they do , but I don't think that's the reason why they're doing this .
I don't know what to say to that ...
I'm not sure if that was intentional or not , but I laughed anyway .
He's not enforcing enough . He's letting the players play and not calling a foul on them .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that it was a good match , but I am very glad it wasn't a boring one .
Richter has more range , but Simon has better combos .
You're in for a treat !
I'm American and I've never heard of this .
I'm sure it will be back , but I don't think it's going to be as popular as the last one was .
I'm not sure if I want to know or not ...
Same here . I was like , wait ... what ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious , but it's because of the way the US is structured that people have to learn to drive in an automatic .
Because you're a drummer ?
I'm a big fan of bears , but they're not my favorite animal .
I got a 5 star Ninian and a 4 star Ninian ... I'm not even mad .
I'm sure you're right , but I just don't want him to be so stressed out about it that he's going to have a panic attack .
That's good , I was worried about them being too aggressive .
Because they're both pretty .
I think so . They're a good team and they've been playing well lately .
I think he's playing a different character in that movie .
I'm in the US and it's working for me .
I think they were just showing off the new technology in the trailer , not really a flashback .
It's not you , it's us !
He s already at 26 and 14
I think you mean Bama TE's .
I'm in Sweden and it's been freezing for weeks now , I think we're due for another one !
Thanks for the report !
The one with the guy who eats his own face .
It is if it's in the public interest .
You're gonna be disappointed if you don't hear it .
I'm pretty sure it's Mohammed bin Salman .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote ...
I'm a sales rep , but I work at a grocery store .
They did , and it was a good one .
I'm not sure what you mean by that ...
I'm sure it's a common thing in the US , but I've never heard of it being taught at my highschool .
I'm sorry to hear that , man . I hope you can find a way out soon !
I thought it was a play on words for'lazy people ' .
I've had that happen to me before too .
I'm glad to help !
I think that's what we're trying to do , but I'm not sure how well it'll work out for us .
I'm a dad and I approve of this comment .
I think so . I'm not sure though .
gl with your life
It's both .
Because they want to make a game that people will buy and play .
It's a good thing you're not a mod , then ...
I think it's a mix of both , but I'm not sure .
He didn't jump , he slid down and then fell over .
I think you're onto something here ...
I was sleeping .
I'm doing well , how about yourself ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not but I've never had brussel sprouts cooked in oil before .
I think it's because he's a witch !
Because it's a good item .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think it's a joke ...
I think that's what the character says when you select them .
He was the best player on our team last year , and he is only 24 years old . He has plenty of time to improve .
I think it's more about the fact that he's not going to be able to drive in the rain .
I'm going to go with the first one .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but Varus is a nuke machine .
Go get some now , it's only a few hours away !
He's a great blocker and has some speed . He could be a solid back up .
I think you mean Revelations , not Revelations .
I'm not sure , but I think they're in there somewhere ...
I'm sure it was a very peaceful and peaceful death , but I'd rather have been shot than be mauled by a bear .
I'm glad you're not blind !
I'm going to see them in November . I'll be there !
I think you mean mammoth .
It's not like they're going to have to use their pistols for anything , right ?
I've had this happen to me , but I'm not sure if it's a bug or a feature .
I'm not really a fan of the game but it's still fun .
RNG has been playing better lately . KT just got a new coach and they are looking to improve their roster .
I'd say a 3 .
He's a good guy , but I think he should have been more careful with his words and actions .
I'm pretty sure that's what happened in the movie .
I'm from Idaho too ! I've been to the same place before and it was awesome .
You'd be surprised how many people are willing to sacrifice their lives for the sake of a song they like .
Zapdos is gone , sorry !
Forest . I like the mountains and forests .
It's a great show . It has some flaws , but overall it is very enjoyable and well made .
I think it was more about the fact that we were up by 20 at one point in the 4th quarter .
I've seen them in the fall too !
I'd rather have him play Batman than Superman .
I've done it before , but not in a while . It was pretty cool .
You can't see anything , but you can hear it .
I'm glad you enjoyed it !
Because it's the offseason .
You don't . It's just a piece of plastic that sticks to the bottom of the cookie and doesn't get stuck .
I think you guys are going to be fine .
I think he looks better in the new movie than he did in the first one .
You're right , I'm not going to wait any longer !
He was in the ring for like 30 minutes , I think that counts as a submission .
I'm so excited to see him as a villain ! I hope he gets more screen time this season .
They're not invading , they're just trying to get a foothold in the region .
It's been like that for a while .
It's a great match but I think the crowd would have been more into it if they had a better story to tell .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is a thing now ...
It's almost like the police are corrupt and they don t care about drug users or addicts .
Yeah I agree with you there .
I am available right now !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not but I think it was sarcasm .
Jesus was white , he wasn't black .
I'm not sure what you're getting at , but it sounds like you're trying to make a point that the US is doing something wrong .
I'm enjoying it , but I think there's a lot of room for improvement on both sides .
I don't think it's a problem , I just thought it was funny .
I'm sure he's a great guy , but I don't think he'd be able to do that .
I've been to Sweden , and I can confirm that they are nice people .
I'm hoping for a Giannis and Embiid collab , but I doubt that will happen .
Astronomy is a term used by astronomers to refer to their field of study .
I'm with you , but I think it's a good bet to be honest .
I've never had a bad experience with them , but they're definitely not for everyone .
I'm pretty sure that was a gift from France to the US .
I think that's because of the fact that they were a unified kingdom , not just a single country .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I'll take it as sarcasm .
They're used for food .
I have the same problem with my Gold subscription . It's not that bad but it is annoying .
I'm not your buddy , guy !
I don't . I think he's a great guy and I'm glad to see him doing well , but I can't stand his attitude .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not .
I'm sorry for your loss .
I'd say so . You can get the same amount of content on PS4 as you could on XB1 .
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I've never had a problem with my clutch slipping out of place while driving .
I'm sorry I didn't know that was a rule . I'll remove it now !
I'm not a fan of the spicy sauce either but it's still good .
Thanks ! I'm a big fan of lettering .
He's a good actor but his character is so bland and boring that it makes me cringe .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ...
I'm not sure what you're trying to say .
That would be a great idea ! I'll try and get some pictures up later today or tomorrow .
What's the difference between VLC and CCCP ?
What kind of stuff do you have ?
I think it's more like a one piece , but with no skin on .
I think he was just upset that she didn't get to go home with him .
I think you mean ope , I'll get it next time .
I think it was just to show that he had his front brake engaged and not disengaged .
I think they're going to buy all their players .
It's a great game , but I'm not sure if it'll be as good as the original .
I was thinking the same thing , but I think it's a lion .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ...
I'm from Germany and I've never seen a vest that wasn't a full body suit .
I think you mean the best timeline .
You can't just say that and not provide a source !
I think it was more of an homage to the movie , not necessarily a reference to the character .
I think he's too busy with The Revenant and the new Star Wars movie to do anything else .
I'm glad you're not afraid . I was worried for a second there .
I m not saying they are going to win but I d rather have them play the 49ers than the Broncos or Seahawks .
I think that was the point , but I'm sure there are people who didn't see it because they thought it was just another Marvel movie .
They did , but they were not the official sponsors of the team .
I'm sure they'll be fine .
I think it would be easier to just make one and harvest the seeds .
I think it's more likely that they'll have a modding API or something similar .
Thanks ! I love it , she's my pride and joy .
Mine did not either ! I was so confused when I saw that message pop up on my phone .
I'm not even sure what that means , but it sounds like a good idea !
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that I got this reference ...
I'm a huge fan of the Strokes . I've been listening to them for years and they're still my favorite band .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is a thing now .
He's not even that good .
I love that part too !
I'm not sure , but I think it's a good idea to keep the thread going .
They're not supposed to be there . They're just there so people can see them .
I am the Senate !
It's not like he had to play with the best players in NA , he could have been playing with the worst players in NA and still be top 3 .
I'll try to get better at it then ! Thanks for the tip !
A tiny , delicious , sweet potato .
That's what I was thinking , but it sounded like he was just trying to get a message across .
He was a liability on defense too , but I think that's what we need to focus on .
I was born in 1993 . I'm not old school , but I'm definitely a young person .
I like it because it's a good way to get into the game without having to worry about getting your character in the first place .
I think she was just being sarcastic , but yeah it would be a bit of an awkward situation for sure lol !
I'm not sure if that's a good idea or not ...
I don't think you're alone , but I'm also not a fan either .
He's a bit of an overrated comedian , but his stand up is pretty good .
You're right , I should have said that it's not a good look for them .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think you're missing a few .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I laughed pretty hard at this .
It's a water bottle .
It's the way they sit on the seat . It's not comfortable , but it is a way to get a better view of your surroundings .
Braum is a new champ , but he's not new to League of Legends . He's been around for years and has had many iterations .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic .
I think you mean 0 5
Because they're the ones who are supposed to be teaching .
Nah he's just going to build a wall and make the North pay for it .
He could have measured it , but didn't want to risk damaging his property .
He was always a bit of a party pooper though .
I think it's because the cans are too big and heavy for their weight .
I'm moving from Austin to El Paso next week !
I think they will be able to do it if they win against tsm and c9 lose against tl
I thought he was wearing a t shirt with a picture of a guy in a suit and tie .
I'm not sure , but I think it's possible .
I think it was 18 . I remember seeing the post on r nba about how many people were there and they said it was 16 .
Because they're ranked in the top 25 .
I'm not sure . I think we're still a little nervous about our game against them .
I member !
They're good if you like a burger with a lot of grease on it .
Yes , but they have to win by 2 goals .
I'm not your city boy , buddy !
I think it was a joke .
I think it's more that they're trying to get the refs to call a foul , but they don't want to do so because it's not a foul .
Why do you think ?
I'm not saying that , I'm just saying it's a possibility .
You know what ? You're right !
He was a good kid .
I'm pretty sure you're wrong about this one ...
He's not a good driver , but I think he could do it .
I'm sure you could find some in a dumpster somewhere ...
I'm sorry to hear that , but you're not alone in this .
He's got some serious heart , he's been training for years .
He's the best player in the world .
I'm glad we didn't have to play this game .
I'm still bitter about that game .
I think they're a top 10 team , but I don't see them beating anyone in the SEC West or even the Big 12 .
I've never seen egg cartons at a supermarket here in the UK .
I think they're still pretty popular .
You can't buy an airline with money you don't have .
I think it's a bit too much for some people , but I'm not sure why .
I've done this before . It works well for me .
That's what I'm doing now , but I don't want to get my hands wet !
I think it's gonna be Caps , he was in the top 10 last season .
It's not a matter of being strict , but rather how you deal with people who are intolerant or violent .
Because he's a good boy .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think that's a pretty good way to describe it .
I'm hoping for a Wii U port of Super Mario RPG .
Happy Birthday !
I'm sure she'll be fine .
I'm not sure what that means but okay ! Thanks for letting me know !
I'm not sure if I should be offended by this comment or not ...
I'm sure you were a good sport about it , though !
I'm not sure if I should be proud that I got to play with you guys . I'll have to ask my friend who's on the other side of town .
I think he's the best player in the world , but I don't know if that's saying much .
I'm sure the penny is still warm from all the salt and pepper .
I got one in my first pack , but I don t think it s guaranteed .
I'm sure it's possible . I don't know how many people are going to survive a shooting like that though .
I'm still waiting for the day he gets a cameo in Thor : Ragnarok .
I think he's just being sarcastic , but I could be wrong .
It's not a jet pack . It's a jet engine .
I think it's more likely they'll draw .
I agree , but I think it's still pretty funny .
I do , but it's not a mandatory thing for me to get .
I think he's going to be in the middle of the movie with a holographic version of himself .
Upvoted . Appreciate it .
I think they're going to end with a big reveal at the end of season 4 .
I'd say the first one .
Yes , you are right . We have won 4 games in a row .
I think so . I've seen a few people do this .
I think it was more of a joke , but yeah , you're right .
FSU has been pretty solid . They're just not playing well on defense .
r nbacirclejerk is a thing now !
It's not . It's just a way of saying I'm American and I don't know what the deal with this is .
I'm not a bot , I just like to help people find things they can't find on their own .
He's been banned in the past , but he was picked in the last tournament .
I think it was a good call , but I don't know if he would've made that kick had they not taken the time out .
I'm glad I wasn't the only one who felt like that .
It's a good thing we have the world's largest oil reserve .
I'm sure they're all in London , but I don't think it's a coincidence .
I think he's the one with the glasses .
me too , me too
I'm glad you got them !
Same here , but I got denied for the same reason .
Warren . He has a better chance of winning the general election than Trump does .
I think it's a young Sam from the show , but I could be wrong .
It's great ! I've played through the whole game and still haven't beaten it .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think that's a pretty good thing .
I think it's more of a case of the mother being too fat and the child being too small .
He's reformed , but not as much as he used to be . He's been doing this for years now .
He's been throwing a lot better lately . He was getting hit in the pocket all last year too .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but the US is a pretty safe place to live in .
I think you're right , but I'm not sure about that .
I think it's a good song . I don't know why people hate it so much though ...
I'm sure you could find a way to do that with some photoshop skills , but I don't think it would look very good .
I woke up at 4:30 am . I was so tired that I had to go to work .
I've read it , and loved it !
He's not that bad , he just has no personality .
I have one that is pretty good for the price . It's not great but it works well enough .
I think we've had enough of those .
I've never had a problem with rice , but I'm not sure if that's what OP was asking about .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've seen a lot of people use this on their bikes and they seem fine .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but he's actually a pretty good actor .
I'm not sure . I think it's more like the Vikings Lions game thread , but with less people talking about how awesome the Vikings are and how much they hate the Lions .
I'm not . It's a great song , and I think it fits the theme of the show perfectly .
It's a joke , I think .
I thought it was a bank too !
He's been playing great , but he's not shooting well from 3 .
I'm sure they'll be fine . They're not going to get a lot of money from the government for this .
I have a few of these , and they're great !
I'm from Texas and we have a lot of different types of food . I've never had conecuh , but it's on my list to try next time I visit home !
I was thinking the same thing ! She's so happy !
He's also played as a striker for Barca and Real Madrid .
I'm going to make a house teleport and call it a house teleporter !
That's what I was thinking too but it seems like they're not doing this for some reason .
I agree with this 100 . I think the new designs are great but the old ones were just so much better .
I'm not sure if this is sarcasm or not , but it's true .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think he's joking about how people drink soda and then die from dehydration .
I have a sweaty hand too !
I would have to agree with you on this one , but I'm not sure if the voltage is what's causing the problem .
It's a lot better than the first one , but not by much .
I'm sure he's a good guy and all but I don't think he'd be able to stop me from taking pictures of my package .
It's on NBC Sports Network , so you can stream it online if you have a cable subscription .
I think it looks like a baby goat , but I'm not sure .
That's a good idea , but I'm not sure if they have the same phone number as my current one .
Mithy is not even close to being the best mid in NA .
I think he'd be fine with it being a secondary .
You're not the only one , my friend !
I'm not sure what the difference between a 360 and a PS3 controller would be but I'll definitely try it out ! Thanks for your input !
I think the point is that they're not going to beat us .
I was thinking the same thing , but I think it's just a reflection of the camera lens .
Stats are everything , but not everything is stats .
RemindMe ! 2 years
I'd be okay with that , but I don't think he's worth that much .
I'm not sure what you mean by this but it's funny because the original Paladin class was called The Priest .
I'm sure you're not the only one who feels that way , but I think it's pretty cool that they did this .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've been playing through the game on my PS3 and it's pretty great .
You're hired !
I'm sure he's a lot more attractive than Hillary .
I think he's just a little bit too busy with the other things to worry about .
Westlake Village , LA
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think that's a good thing .
It's a great flavor ! I've been trying to find it in the states for years , but no luck yet .
I'm not a spy . I'm an adult .
I'm sure it'll be back in the rotation soon enough .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think it's a reference to the movie Birdman .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think it was a joke ...
I'm sure you can find someone who will take care of your name for you , but I don't think anyone would want to be called that .
I think that's a good thing . It looks like a really cool effect , but I don't want to see it in game .
He's been working on his FT for years , he just doesn't have the confidence to make them consistently .
I think you're right . It's just that the pictures are so cute and adorable , but they don't really fit with the sub .
EA . I'm not even a big fan of the game and I've been playing it for years .
I'm not sure if I've ever seen a movie where Tucci is in it but I'll take your word for it .
He was the only one who could get a shot off , but he couldn't finish .
It's a chihuahua ? I thought it was a pug !
I'm glad you're sleeping !
You're a good man .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but that's actually a quote from Socrates .
You're a good man .
It's a great show , you should watch it !
He was a starter for us last year , so he can probably still play at a high level .
He's not a good QB .
I think it's a little bit of both .
I'm in Canada , and I've never seen a single one for sale here .
That's awesome !
Purdue is playing great , but OSU is playing pretty good too .
I'm not sure what you're getting at here ...
I'm not even mad .
I'm sure you'll be fine , but it's not like he has a choice in the matter .
I'm not going anywhere , I just want to go home .
I don't think so because I haven't gotten one yet and I have been playing for about 2 weeks now .
I'm not sure what you're talking about , but I'll take it !
I've always heard it as a combination of the two .
If we get a TD , I'll be happy with that .
I'm surprised you didn't see the comments on this thread , it's pretty much all xenophobia and nationalism .
I think it's because they're all at the same range , and you can't see their health bars .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but he's a dragon .
Because he's a good actor .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this comment ...
The Rock from the Moon
I'm not sure if you're being serious ... But I think the idea is to make it look like a kid is holding it up .
I think it's more likely that Australia will make it than Qatar .
I think it's just because they're wearing a lot of makeup and have long hair .
That's what I thought too , but then I remembered that the movie is set in the 70s and not the 80 ' s .
They're already doing that .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not .
That's what I do too !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but it's a good thing that people are willing to be brave and wear their clothes in public .
Because Jesus is a good guy .
I think I'm gonna have to agree with you on this one ...
Groundhog Day 2 : The Search for More Money
I'm sorry to hear that , but I hope you can find a way out of this .
It's on PC too , but I don't think it'll be ported to PS4 .
I think the first one was pretty good and the second one was okay . The third one was just awful .
I'd be more worried about the Iron Giant's legs than his arms .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but it's actually a pretty good starterpack .
I was going to ask if that was the same one . It looks like it is !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ... but that's the best timeline for everyone involved !
I have one too . It's great for music and movies .
I'm not sure what I expected .
I think so , but I'm not sure .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not .
I think it does 50 , but I'm not sure .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this .
I think it's more about the fact that they're not going to release a new version of Android until at least 2018 , and then probably 2019 .
It's a good thing you're not a doctor .
I think it's more that people don't want to pay for their own car .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think that's actually a pretty good idea ...
I think he was just going to stop and let the other guy pass , but then realized that he had no time to react .
Modric is not that great , but he's definitely up there for me .
I'm sure that's why they're all dating guys who are taller than them .
Thanks ! I'll keep that in mind for next year's car .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but it's a great show and the books are amazing too !
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry at this ...
I'm Dutch and I care .
I'm with you on that one . It's a terrible movie and the acting is awful .
I think that's a good point . I'm not sure why you're being downvoted though ...
I'm pretty sure he's talking about the fact that they can't see him .
I'm sure there are plenty more people who have been murdered by the state than that many .
I'm pretty sure that's only for the first one .
I'd be okay with that .
I think it's a good thing . It makes her look like she's about to cry .
I haven't but I've heard good things about them !
I think it's the right one , but I agree that the left one looks off .
He's not . He's just faster and has a better car .
I'm not sure , but I think you are .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but that's a great analogy .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I've never seen any snow on Haleakala .
I think you mean the Titans are that good team who , when they lose to them , motivates teams to get their act together .
Adblock Plus ?
He was born at least 12 years old .
I'm still not convinced .
The last game against Hull .
I'm sorry for your loss .
And there was a lot more than one touchdown .
I'm not sure if that's what I said , but I think it is .
I'm not saying it's realistic , but it's certainly possible .
He's a bit of a joke .
I think you're right , but I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not ...
I hope so . I want to see him hit one of those three pointers .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think he's actually trying to make a gameboy clone .
He was just trying to get out of there before he got too much of a headache from the cold .
I'm just saying that the game looks like a monster hunter game and I'd rather have this than world .
It's not like they're trying to be funny or anything , it's just a joke .
I think he was there for the first half of the season , but then he got injured and left .
He is a good boxer , but he has no chin and his fights are usually very sloppy .
It can . I have a few of them on my Wii U .
He's just happy he got it for Christmas !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not .
Horizon is a great game , but I think the story is pretty weak compared to other games in the series .
It's a Tuesday night game , and the weather has been pretty bad all week .
I think it was more that they were all playing against each other , and not just one another .
I got mine from a local shop in the UK . They're pretty cheap and they look great !
We have a lot more to learn .
I'm sure you're right , but I think there's a difference between denying and acknowledging .
I have the same thing but with 86 time on fire .
I think it was a bit of both .
Same here . I've been playing it for about 2 months now and have only gotten 1 stage .
I'd take him over KP any day of the week , but I'm not sure that's what you're looking for .
He's a good player but not the best .
I'm sure she is , but I don't think it's a good idea to be that loud at a party .
I'd love to see a remaster of Bulletstorm on PS4 .
I agree with you there .
I think it's the same one . I've been there before and it was beautiful !
I was thinking more of a mix between the two , but I can see where you're coming from !
It's a good smell , but it doesn't really come out of the oven . It comes in the pan and then drizzles on top of the pan .
I'm not sure , but I think it's because they're trying to make a living off of this .
I've never had it , but I'm sure you could find some .
I'm not sure what you're talking about ...
I've been meaning to get into them ! I'll definitely give it a listen . Thanks !
You will be able to see your ban history .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic .
173664 . What about my friend's ?
I mean , it's not like they're going to win anyway .
I agree , but I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not ...
Flacco has been pretty good . He's just had a few bad games , but he's still doing well .
I think you mean fifth dad .
I'm sure you're right . I just don't want to be that guy who says something and then gets downvoted for it .
I'd like a pm too please . Thanks !
I'll take it . I've never had a good meal there , but that sounds like a great deal !
I'll try that out ! Thanks for the suggestion !
She's got a lot of collarbones , too !
I remember those !
He was a beast at the Olympics too !
I think it's more that he's a troll , but I agree with you on the insufferability part .
I think it's more likely they own the majority of the stations in the area , and are trying to get them all out there for free .
I'm not even sure what I expected from the start of the season , but it's been pretty good so far !
They're all in the crowd .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote you for that one ...
Bobby Petrino and the rest of his staff .
I love mine !
I'm sure they're all just happy to have someone else's kids , right ?
It's a sign of affection .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think it's funny that you think this is an insult .
I'm a big fan of the show too ! I've been watching it since season 1 and have only gotten better each time .
He did , but they're not going to believe him because he doesn't have a strong enough case for being president .
I thought it was a reference to Conan the Barbarian .
I'm not from either of those places but I am a Canadian citizen and I have been living in the US for about 10 years now .
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted , it's true .
I'm not even close .
I'm sure there are plenty of places that would be cheaper than the city .
Because they're not in danger of being hit by a car . They're in danger of getting hit by a car .
I'm hoping they'll port it to switch too ! I've been waiting for overwatch since launch day !
I've lived in both places . Donut shops are real food .
I'm sorry for your loss .
I think it would be a tsunami .
I'm not sure why I was downvoted but okay .
It's a great show , but it's not for everyone .
I'm not basing it on anything , I'm just saying that the two candidates have different qualities and policies .
I think he was just trying to get a flag .
It's a good trick !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I've never seen it in the wild before ...
I'm American , I don't have ads on my TV .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it's pretty funny that he was so upset about the whole thing .
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I think you're right .
I'm sorry , I don't understand .
I think he's saying that the tax breaks are for the land , not the ranch .
I'm sorry to hear that , but it is a good thing you're not pregnant !
I think it's the fans of both teams .
I think you mean top tier adjecent
I think you mean a sphere , but I'm not sure .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but that is a very good point .

Thanks for the clarification !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I've seen a lot of people say this .
I'm sure they're just as shocked as we are !
I think it's a good song , but I don't know if it'll be as big of an impact as some others have made .
I've never heard of that , but I'm sure it's true .
u shanisian is the only one I know who has been active in this sub for quite some time .
It's not boring if you're watching it for the first time .

I'm not a mod , I'm an admin !
I was thinking the same thing !
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I agree with your sentiment .

I like the clutch jersey but I think the golden guardians one is a little too much for me to wear .
He's not . He's just a good actor and he has a lot of charisma .
Because he's not fighting for the belt , but rather to get his money back from the UFC .
It is , but that's not what he said . He said Africanus .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think it's a joke about how people have been saying that the duck is CGI for years now .
I'm sure he's not the only one who has been told that .
I'm a big fan of the Smurf !
I think it's a requirement .
I'm sorry for your loss .
I'm in the same boat as you . I've caught a few sandshrews but no magikarps yet ...
I think he's a better fit for the offense . He can't be that bad at all , but I don't know if he'll be as good on defense .
I agree , but I think it's more about the lack of content than anything else .
It's not , but it's still a good thing he's being investigated for .
I think you mean stream sniping , but yeah , that's what he said .
r toomeirlformeirl is a thing .
It's not like they're going to be able to tell the difference between a finished piece of art and a finished piece of art anyway , so why bother ?
I think it's a good question , but I'm not sure if the answer is actually correct or not .
We're all here get banned , we're all here get banned .
I would if I could .
I love mine , but I've only had it for a few months now .
He's a good player , but he's not as good as his dad .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think this is a joke ...
Thanks ! PM'd you the link .
I'm sorry to hear that man ...
Thanks , I'm glad it's not just me !
I'm not a Chelsea fan but I'll be cheering for him to get his first goal this season !
You should probably get that looked at .
I'm not sure if that's a joke or not .
I did . I'm hoping for a good day today , but it's looking like it won't be that great .
Swiss here , can confirm .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I'll take that as a compliment !
I have a galaxy s4 and it has this feature .
OSU has been pretty solid .
That's a good choice !
I have no idea what's going on there ... I'm not sure if you're using a VPN or not ?
I'm glad you're not pregnant anymore .
He's a good guy , but he's no Garrosh .
You can use it twice . Once for each card , and again for each promo .
You're not alone in that opinion .
I think it's more about the fact that he's not going anywhere and we're in for him .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not ... but I love that subreddit so much .
I'm pretty sure that seals don't have souls either ...
I think you mean President of Humanity .

I think you mean Death Note .
I think you're right !
He's a great guy , I hope he stays with us for awhile !
Yeah , I'm not a fan of the zoomed sight either .
Done ... Plz upvote back
I'm still excited about it ! I think it's going to be a great movie and I hope they do a good job with it .
I have that one too ! I love it :D
I agree , but I think it's still worth mentioning that the US is not as good at making cars as Japan or China .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think he's saying that the Packers are a good team and should be in the playoffs .
Nigeria is in the group with Argentina .
I'm sure he's not the only one who feels that way .
I'd say that's a pretty good reason to not go .
He's looking down her skirt .
I'm sure he's not making that much in a month .
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I agree with your sentiment .
1 . r askreddit 2 . I'd love to go to a place with a lot of people and not be alone .
I think it's more likely that he'd get traded than lose his job .
I'm not sure about that , but I'll take it !
She's a witch ! Burn the witch !
I'm with you on that one , but I think the Chevy commercials are just trying to get people to buy their cars .
I'd be okay with that .
I think the idea was that you could have a character with a number and a special character .
I'm not sure what you mean by this . Are you saying that the NPCs aren't real ?
It's not solid , it's a mixture of tar and water .
I think it's too short for that . I'd rather have a full length game than a short one .
I'm Indian and I don't think that's true .
You're right ! I'm a nerd for sure but I love all of those games .
I'm not sure what you're getting at but I agree with your sentiment .
He is fluent in english .
I'm sure they're not going to be able to get jobs in the US .
I think it's the guy from the first movie .
Fnatic will win worlds , but they won't be the best team in the world .
Or the Matrix sequels .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it's pretty clear that this was a joke .
I think the only reason they would retire is if they got replaced by someone better .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is a thing ...
I'm not saying it's a bad thing , but I think that movie was better than Pocahontas .
Because you're a kid .
Cinci is a very good team . They're just not playing well right now .
We're not playing you guys this year , but we'll be there next year if you make it .
You're not alone !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think it was a joke about how they were so hated by the fans .

I'm aware but it's still a shame that the last two are no longer available .
I'm sorry for your loss .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I laughed pretty hard at this .

I mean , he can heal for more than 1k
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think that's a pretty good point .
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I don't think it's a bad thing .
I've never had a Wendy's that wasn't a disappointment .

You mean like the UK ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think that's a pretty good joke .
I think you mean a maul .
Or the power cord in my house .
I think so . They have to beat Bama and FSU though .
I'm not sure if I should be excited or scared that this could happen ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote you for this comment .
No worries . Thanks for your help !
I'm not sure if you're serious , but it's actually a pretty good sandwich .
It's not that bad if you're not in the city .
No , they would have been eliminated .
It's still growing !
It was . He got the ball first and it hit his arm .
Or they're just going really fast and have no idea what's going on .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not but I agree with your sentiment .
I think you mean barricaded door .
I think they are just really good at attacking .
Because it's the same guy .
I think it's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski , where he is a character from that movie .
I'm sure it's not the best idea to use bear spray on your own bear .
I think it's more of an inside joke than anything else , but I get what you mean .
I think you mean if the Grizz had started the game with a lead and won .
I'm in the same boat as you . I've been playing a lot of Destiny lately and it's really fun but I don't have any friends to play with .
You're a good neighbor !
I think you mean the movie that made me cry .
I'm not sure if I should be offended or not .
She was in a lot of Sci Fi films , but I think she was mostly just in the original Star Wars trilogy .
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry at this comment ...
I was thinking about it for a while , but then I realized that they're all in the same place .
I agree , but it would be nice if we could get a draw in the final .
I think he's going to be a free agent after this year , but I don't know if he'll be able to get past the Spurs .
I'm not sure . I think it's more like a quarter gallon .
I think they're great , but I'm not sure if it's a cash grab or not .
I'm not saying he's dead , just that he's been shot at .
I think that's what he was trying to say .
You're a good person .
I think they're trying to be more like England , but I don't know if that's what you meant by'never go full England ' ...
I agree , but it's not a bad thing to do .
I've never been there but I'm sure it's worse than Michigan .
I'm sure he's a great guy .
I'm not sure what you're asking me but yes that's correct !
It was a good movie though .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think he's saying that there are no pads in the real world because they don't exist in the game .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic but I'll take it as sarcasm .
He's a vampire .
I agree ! I was so sad when it ended ...
It's not over yet !
I think that's the point of this thread ...

It was a joke , but I guess it didn't come across well .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think that's what he was going for .
I'm not a Muslim , but I've never heard of that happening in the past .
It's a tattoo .
I think we're just a little rusty , but I'm not sure what that has to do with anything .
What's your current job ?
You're in for a rough time , my friend !
I'm not a fan of the helmet either ...
The Jets and losing their first round pick ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not .
I think they did . I remember the first time I saw it , it was pretty bad .
I think you mean'any secretly amazing strikers ' , but I'm not sure if that's what he meant ...
I'd be fine with this if it was just an option for me , but I don't want to pay for something I can't use .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but it's a bit of an exaggeration .
They're not native to Ireland , but they do live there .
He's not . He's just a bit nervous .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but that's the best way to get them to stop moving around and start eating their food .
I'm not changing my password . I just want to know what the password will be for this account .
It's not that hard to understand , it's just the way they're written .
I'm sure he was just trying to get his hands on some plutonium .
Or Disney's Star Wars : The Force Awakens
I'm not saying we won't get orbs but it's a lot more than just orbs .
I'm hoping for the same thing , but I think it's more likely that we get a corner in the first round than a safety .
Nope , I'm with you on that one .
I'm not sure what you're getting at , but I'll take it as a compliment !
He's not fat , he just has a lot of muscle mass .
I hope you're doing better now !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I've never seen anyone use Google Earth .
A surprise , to be sure , but a welcome one .
I'm sorry to hear that .
Kevin . I think it was a close fight , but I'm not sure .
I think it's called a province , but I'm not sure .
I think you mean the poorest people on Earth .
I think he's going to be a great player , but I don't see him being the best ever .
Because he's a good fighter and has been for years ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious but I think that's a pretty good idea actually ...
I'm not sure what I expected from this comment chain ...
I did too , but I was just wondering if anyone else had this problem .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic , but I think the Moto G5 is a better phone than the 6 .
Or you can play TF2 while playing TF2 .
Ricciardo has a better car , but Vettel is faster .
I'm not sure what you're talking about , but I think they were both pretty good in college .
I think the pronunciation is similar to the way it's spelled in the movie .
You're not even close .
I think so . He's been playing well for us , and I'm sure he'll be a starter at some point this season .
I think you're already there .
I'm not sure . I think they're in a different galaxy than ours .
It's treason then ...
I don't know of any that I've used personally but you can try .
I'm sorry for your loss .
You're welcome
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is the first time I've seen him fight .
He's not frugal . He's just rich and has a lot of money .
I agree , but I think it is a bit more than just that .
I'm watching it on ESPN 3 , but I don't think they have a stream for it yet .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think the point is that he's not going to be able to cut weight .
I'm sure it is , but I don't think that's the reason why they're doing this .
He was trying to get him to stop .
Done , please return the favor !
Because they're not in the same country .
Navas has been playing well for the past few months though .
Because it looks like one .
I'm sure you're right , but I don't think it's a coincidence that they have more pesticide use than any other country on earth .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I love that quote .
I'd buy that for a dollar !
I'm not sure what you mean by this ...
I love you too , I'm sorry for your loss .
I've never heard of that one , but I'm sure you're right .
I'm not . I'm an American citizen , and I don't believe in religion or politics .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but it's a joke about the fact that he was in the game for like 10 minutes and then disappeared .
I'm not sure if I should laugh at this comment , or cry .
I'm going to try that , thanks for the suggestion .
I'm sure you can find a way to get your country back together again .
He's a freshman . He's been playing well , but he's not really a starter yet .
You can get the watch app on Android , iOS and Windows .
I think he's worth it but I don't want to see him go anywhere near that much money .
I think it was the same way with RDA . He just kept going until he got tired of it .
I'm talking about the original game , not the expansion .
I'm interested in the Quirky Collection ! PM me your info and we can work out the details .
I'd be okay with that , but I'm not sure how it would work out for the rest of us ...
I feel ya . I've been doing it for years and I'm not even old enough to drink yet .
I thought it was him too !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think it's pretty clear that he was a minor detail in this case .
I think he's gonna get the next title shot if he wins .
I'm sure he's dead by now ...
It's a good comic , but it's not really a comedy . It's just a story about a guy who has to deal with his own problems and struggles .
I think it's more about the quality than the rating .
I know , but I'm not sure if they were expected to win or not .
It's a reference to the movie The Road , which was made by the same people who did the original Chicken Run .
Priestess , she's the only one who can actually be considered a good character in this game .
She has six toes , but only two toes on each foot .
I've never seen one that wasn't full , but I have seen a few that were empty .
That's awesome , what kind of job is it ?
It's real ! It's just not very well known .
It's not like they're going to be shooting in the same location every week , it'll just be a different shot .
That's awesome ! I'm sure you'll be able to get some good answers from the people who know him .
Because it's not illegal to park in the street .
I agree with you on that one . It was a good call by the refs though .
I was thinking more like a young Michael Cera .
I think he's trying to get the ball out of his hands before he gets tackled .
I think it's because of the lighting . They're still blue in my house .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote you for this comment ...
I did . It's a good thing I'm not deaf , then !
I hope he is a cameo , but not as a main character .
Score more goals than the other team and then we'll know what to do with our hands .
It's a common thing in the UK , but it's not as common in the US .
I'm going to guess that it'll be Ryse , but I don't know for sure .
I'm sure there are a lot more people who don't know about it than there are people that do .
You can't hear the sound of your own voice ?
I'm rooting for you guys , but I don't want to root against you .
I think it's a good thing they didn't use the same sound effects for the prequels .
I'm going with the former , but I think this is a good move for both parties involved .
It's a play on words of the word conducive , which means to be prepared for .
I don't think they were that good , but I do respect them for taking down Lebron and his team .
It's a bug . It's been fixed in the latest update .
The one after that .
I think you're right . It's just a little bit of fun to see what people will do with it .
I'm a fan of the burritos .
I'm feeling good . I think we're going to be a better team than last year and that's what matters most for us .
I think you mean if it wasn't for the fact that he didn't have enough time to react to the ulti .
I'm sure you can find some way to make it look better , but I'd still say that's pretty good .
Kobe haters are the worst kind of people , they're just trying to make themselves feel better about their own shortcomings .
Lol , both .
Charlie Day would be a great Walter White .
I think he's at like 1.5 2 pounds .
I'm not sure , but I'd say it's unlikely .
Blue is the best color for purple .
I think it's more of a case of people not knowing what they're talking about than anything else , but I agree with you on that one .
I agree with this statement 100 .
I'm not hating on him at all . I just think he's a bit overrated .
I think it's on PBS , but I'm not sure if they have a show for him anymore .
I'm sorry for your loss .
I'm pretty sure that was a joke .
I'm not sure what you mean , but I'll take that as a compliment !
I'm sorry but the order is already placed .
I'm sure they'll have plenty of snipers in the next patch .
I'm sorry for your loss .
It's a good look for her .
I have the same pair and love them , but I'm not sure if they're worth it for me .
He's also the best actor on the show , and he's not even the main character !
Yeah , I was thinking the same thing . The dad is definitely a mvd .
Happy Birthday !
I'm sure you're a great person , but I don't think that's what the OP was asking for .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think that's a pretty good idea actually ...
I'm in the middle of a game of league right now . I'm so jealous .
I think it's a good song , but I don't like that guy .
Tatum is a good fit with the Celtics . I think he would be a great fit in Boston .
I've heard about this place ! I'll have to check it out sometime soon . Thanks for sharing !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic but I'll take your word for it .
I'm interested . How much ?
I was thinking more like a young , fat , balding , bearded , slightly overweight , slightly younger version of the Grand Champion .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing ...
I think he's a good guy , but I don't know if he's a good person .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that I got this reference ...
I'm sure they could find someone who can do it justice .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I don't think that's a fair comparison .
It's a good thing that they didn't have to use any ramps at all !
I'm not a fan of TSM , but I don't think they deserve to be in Worlds .
He's a master of karate and friendship for everyone !
You can't . It's a legal process .
I'm from Atlanta and I've never heard of this . What is it ?
I got mine for like 30 .
I think that's what he meant by'legendary ' .
I'm a spaniard and I loved it !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think it was more like 7:30 .
He's not that bad , he just doesn't play defense and can't shoot the 3 ball well enough .
He's the new face of WWE .
And then he gets arrested for being a cop and not a narc .
You should try it . It's fun and you can get some good laughs out of it .
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
He is not bad but he has been playing with a lot more confidence than last year .
You're probably good . The AI is pretty bad , but it's not impossible to beat them with a few characters .
It's a great touch , but I think it would be better if they had more of them .
I think the whole thing was just a little too much for me to handle , I'm glad they're trying something different next season though !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think this is a good question to ask .
I'm still waiting for a sequel .
I've been trying to get into that lately !
He's got that extra chromosome , but he doesn't have the extra chromosome to be a potato .
The opposite of safe is not safe .
It's on Netflix , but you have to watch it in order to understand what's going on .
I think it's just a coincidence that he has a Dutch name .
I'm not sure , but I think that's what they were doing .
I'm not asking anyone to be rational . I'm asking for opinions and opinions are always wrong .
Because you're a man .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not but I like your style !
He was a great player but not the greatest . He had some great moments and some bad ones .
I think he's too good of a coach . I'd rather have him as a GM or something .
It wasn't a deliberate handball though ...
I'm sure you're a great person , but I don't think that's what he meant by'ignoring problems ' .
I usually just go with the receipt and leave it at home .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this ...
I think he's a bit too happy for that though , I'd say it was more like a celebration than anything else .
I'm not sure what you're talking about , but it looks like he has a beard now .
I think it's a reflection of the camera lens , not the driver .
They were probably wearing uniforms .
I think he is a great actor , but his character in this movie was just ... not funny .
I think he's been playing there for a while now , but I'm not sure if it's his natural position or not .
I've had a few people try to get into my car and it's always locked .
It's a great show , and they're doing well with their new talent .
I'm in !
I think you're right . I'm just saying that the majority of Christians don't believe in evolution , and it's a pretty big deal to them .
I think you mean George Carlin .
I think it's more that they're trying to get people to buy their products .
That's what I thought too .
I'm excited for the next one !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but it was a joke ...
I'm from the UK and we have them here too !
I did , but it didn't work for me . I had to go back and forth between the two doors .
I'm pretty sure it's because the mods are asleep or something .
I'm open for anything . I've never played any of the others , but I'd be willing to try them out if they're good .
I'm not sure if you're joking or not but I think that was a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski .
I'm sorry . I didn't mean to be rude or anything but I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were talking about .
He's been playing well for us this year . He was pretty good in the playoffs too .
I think you mean 5 7
I'm a big fan of the creatures too !
I think it's more like 500k or so .
Because they're not in Australia .
I'm pretty sure that was just a joke .
I'm sure he was a good person , but I don't think he's a good person .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think it's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski .
Because he's a good guy and has done some good things in the past ?
I'm a trucker , and I can confirm that this is true .
I'm sure he's a nice guy .
I think that's the norm . I've never heard of anyone getting less than 6 months .
I'm going to watch it on my laptop with a friend who doesn't have cable .
I'd watch it if they did it like that sketch where they had a guy who was just a regular guy and he's really into music .
Because they're a good team .
I thought the same thing , but I think that's because it was a parade sized balloon .
You're not alone !
I'm not sure what you're trying to say here ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad about this ...
I think it's more that they're both black and have different personalities than the other .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ...
It's a joke about how the show is on the same day as the movie .
It was a yellow , but it's still a foul .
I'm afraid so , yes !
I think it was a good game .
I think they're going to make a movie about the original Star Wars trilogy , and then Disney will buy it back .
I've seen plenty of chicks who have had babies from birds .
I'm not sure if you're joking or not but I think that's actually a thing ...
I think you're hired !
Yeah , I'm hoping for that too !
And Osama bin Laden was a terrorist too !
I'm not sure if that's a joke or not .
I think you mean 24 7 news channels , not 24 hour news stations .
I got a lot of words that I didn't know .
I've had zero problems .
I'll be on in a few hours .
I got a shiny Wingull from the event , but I'm not sure if it was a legit one or not ...
I think he's more of a dark greyish color .
I think they're trying to get the crowd into it and make it seem like they're going to win .
I think it's more surprising that they're both expecting a win .
I'm in the same boat , but it's not too late to start again !
It's a great show , but it's not for everyone . It's definitely worth watching if you're into that sort of thing though !
I'm already awake .
I think we're at 7 .
They are not humans . They are a species of alien .
I think you mean the iPhone isn't selling because of the notch , but because of the notch .
I have a pair of safety glasses and they're great .
Yes . The clock starts when the ball crosses the line of scrimmage and ends when the play is over .
I was thinking more of the fact that they didn't have any ostriches in Minnesota .
I'd rather have him stay in Cleveland , but if he goes there , it'll be for a different reason .
I think he was just trying to get out of there , but I'm not sure .
I think they are , but I don't see them making a big impact in tournaments .
I'm not sure , but it's probably a joke .
I think Veas has a better chance of being a starter than Ward does .
I think it's more about the fact that they're playing in a friendly .
He's not even American , he's from Canada .
I thought it was a guitar ...
I'm not sure what you're talking about , but we have a pretty good bench .
Yeah I've heard that too !
I'm sure it was just a prank bro .
I'm sure they would have if it wasn't for the fact that they are owned by Google .
They did . It was a good call , but it wasn't a catch .
I think she's single now .
He's been doing it for years now .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that we're ranked higher than you guys ...
I'm not sure what you're talking about , but I love the name !
I think we're both pretty happy with the way things are going in VA right now .
He's not your comrade , comrade .
I think he's just gonna name them after the characters in the game .
And my axe !
He's a real life Captain Hook !
I think he's going to be a great coach for years to come but I don't think he'll last long enough to get that extension .
I've never been there but I'm sure it is a thing !
I'm sure they'll find something else to distract us from this .
I think it's just a thing in America .
I loved it , but I think it was just too long and not enough action .
It's not even close . Brazil vs Germany was bigger than this .
Because it's a common assumption .
I think he means the ball is going to the other team .
I think they should .
I do , but I'm not sure if it's worth it for me to get a new console just because of this game .
I'm not sure if this is a joke or not ...
They had a lot of food and water .
Melo is a top 5 player in the league .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think China has a lot of similarities with the US .
I think you mean the school .
I think that was a joke , but I could be wrong .
It is a tree .
You're not a real human being .
I'm not sure what you mean by run but I agree with this statement .
I think they have a few , but I'm not sure if they're native to the country or just in the area around it .
I'm surprised it didn't get more attention , I thought it was really good !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ... but I think it's funny that we are the first team to score a golden goal back then !
I'm from Amboy !
You can't even swing a hammer with your right arm !
I'm down with that !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but fried chicken with waffle fries is pretty much the best combo ever .
I'm a big fan of the ' 98 team , but I don't think they had a great squad at all .
I think it was the first song on the album , and it sold like hotcakes .
That's what I'm hoping for !
I think the defense is playing well enough to keep them in it .
I'm sorry for your loss .
I'll look into it , thanks !
I think it's a good idea , but the jump around is just too much fun to watch .
I'm sure it was the avocado , but I think it's more likely to have been the watermelon juice .
No , he was booked for dissent and dissent is a yellow card offence in the league .
I'm so glad I didn't have a heart attack .
I mean we're not that good but it's still a pretty big step up from last season and the year before .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think that's a bit too much faith for one man .
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry ...
I'm not even sure what that means , but I agree .
I'm sure that'll work out well for you !
I've had two of those in my life ...
I'm in the Plaza , just send me a trade when ready !
I'm pretty sure that's what they were going for with this one .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic but I think it's a bit of both .
I think it's because they're not going to be able to sign him .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but they have a new location in the same building as the old one .
I've never heard of this , but I'll look into it ! Thanks for the tip !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think that's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski .
Yes , they have .
I think it was a mod , but I'm not sure if there are any mods for the game .
I'm not sure if it's a joke or not .
I think you're right !
I'm sure you'll be fine !
It's not a buff , it's a nerf .
Because he's a doctor .
I'm a big fan of the one on the left , but it's not a brewery hat .
The Great Depression 2 : The Great Depression Strikes Back
It's a common mistake , but the correct way to spell it is to and from .
You're welcome , I'm glad to see someone else is getting into this game .
I'm not even mad . I'm just impressed that we're still in it at all .
I'm sure they're just eating the babies .
I use the shopping portal and it works great .
Yeah , I saw him at the Hollywood Bowl last night and he was there . He's got a new album coming out soon too !
I'm 5 ' 10 and 180ish and I've been working out for a while so I think I'll be fine !
I've done this before and it works great !
I got mine from a local shop called The Kitchen . They have a few different flavors and they're all pretty good quality .
6 ' 9 or 6 ' 10 depending on the shoes .
I'm a size 12 , so it's not too bad for me !
It's a Germanic language .
He threw a good one , but he didn't win .
I think it's more that people thought they would be able to beat Germany , and then they lost to Portugal .
I'm not sure if you're serious ... But I've never used youtube , so I don't know what it's like .
I've built a few rc planes and they all have died .
I have like 20 games on steam and I don't even own any of them .
I think he's afraid of Gus because he knows he can't beat him , but I don't know if he really cares about winning .
There's a lot of us !
They were so salty .
It's called the Tokyo Dome . It's a Japanese sports app that is very popular in Japan and has been around for years .
I think they're just the logo of the team , but I could be wrong .
I'm glad someone else remembers that song !
I'm surprised that the number is so low , but it's still a lot higher than the US average .
I'm a blacksmith and I can't even imagine how much more complicated this would be if you could just use the same tools for all of your jobs ...
Don't be nervous , it's not that bad .
I know , it's just that I've been reading a lot of stuff about depression lately so I thought you might be interested in some more .
He's a professional . He probably saw someone do it and then just didn't want to admit that they were wrong .
I think it's a joke . He's the only player on the team who can actually play defense and has been playing well this season .
I think the point is that they were out of time , and therefore couldn't win .
I think it was his second , actually .
Ah , I see what you mean now . Thanks !
I hope so . I loved her in the first season of The League , and she was great as a host on that show !
I'm sorry for your loss .
I think you mean UCF is just UF , but with more money .
The king in the north !
I think he's referring to the fact that he was on his way back from the airport , not that he was actually there .
I'm sure he's just using it for his own personal use , but I've seen people do this with their phones and they're still microwaved .
I think it's also a good name for a dog .
I'm not sure what that means ...
I'm a Saints fan and I want the bears to win so bad !
I'm sorry , I don't understand your comment . What are you trying to say ?
It gets much better , but it's still not as good as the original .
5 11 stature is a thing .
There's always the possibility of a villain , but I don't think it'll be a main character .
They are so good . I'm not a fan of chocolate , but this one is amazing .
I'd watch it .
I think he did , but I don't think he would have been able to finish him if he had to .
I'm not sure if you are being sarcastic or not , but I think it's funny .
A pair of jeans and a pair of shoes .
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I think it's more like 30 40 hours if you're playing on the same level as your main .
That's awesome ! I've never seen that before , but it sounds like something you'd see in a movie or TV show .
Meditech is a good company but they're not the best in the world .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think it's a good book and I recommend reading it .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this is a thing .
It's a lot more open .
I've seen it . It's not bad but I don't think it's as good as the book .
That's what I thought too !
I like this one better because it's a bit more accurate .
Logic is a tool for making sense of things . It doesn't make you right or wrong .
You're just jealous because you don't have the upper body strength of a gnat .
I'm sure they're doing it for the money .
I'm not sure , but I think it's on Amazon Prime .
I'm not even mad . That was amazing !
Yeah I'm not sure why they do it but I guess it's to make people feel like they're getting something out of the game .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've seen a few of these in the wild .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this ...
I think you mean semi's . Semis is the final .
That's because they're all terrible .
I'm a browns stoke fan too !
I think he's a great actor , but his character in this film is just so ... meh .
I think he means the first one .
I think that's a dog .
She's not bad , just not great .
Yeah , I've got it loaded and it's not there .
She's just trying to get her own little slice of cake .
I'm jealous of you right now !
I'm not changing factions , I just don't like the idea that we have to wait for a week .
I think it's more of a political suicide to leave the EU , but I'm not sure about that one .
Ice town was a great movie !
You're not getting banned for this .
I'm American and I've never heard of this sport , but it sounds fun !
I'm sure there are plenty . I think the problem is that they're not good at it , and don't have enough resources to do so .
You're not the only one !
I'm so sorry . I hope you feel better soon !
I'm not sure about that , but I do know that LSU is going to win .
It's called r wowcirclejerk
I do . I'm a Canadian and I love Canada !
He's not going anywhere , but he's definitely not a good fit for the show .
Pobelter had no pressure on the map . He just got caught out by the enemy team and couldn't do anything about it .
I'm sure he'll be on the phone with them in a few minutes , but I doubt they'd want him to talk about it .
He's a good guy but I don't think he's trying to cover anything up . He just doesn t want people thinking that he is a bad person .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think that's the joke ...
You're not alone .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ...
Same here . I'm running a GTX 970 , but it's not the game that is causing the lag . It's my internet connection .
I'm sure you'll be fine , but if you're not careful , you might end up with a broken arm or something .
I think he's talking about the last play .
I think they're going to have to do some sort of ritual , but I don't know how much more specific it is .
He's not a Jedi , he's a master porg !
I've seen it happen , but not with Irelia .
I'm sure he's fine , but I don't think it would be a good idea to throw a ball at someone who has been hit by a football before .
I think it's a good thing they're not doing the black suit , because I'm pretty sure that would be too much for them to do .
I think he's a great actor but his character is so over the top and annoying that it makes me cringe every time I see him on screen .
That's a good point , I hadn't thought of that .
I do , but I'm not a smoker .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but it's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski .
That's what I figured , thanks !
We can't afford to lose Casey , he's a good coach but he's not the answer for this team .
I'm pretty sure that's a reference to the movie .
I think it's more about his personality than anything else , but I agree with you . He seems like a good dude and has a great sense of humor .
We get to play the Cubs in the World Series , and they win .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that we're the only ones who have a sense of humor about this whole thing ...
He was just trying to get out of the way so he could run faster !
I'm going to be there in a few weeks !
I'm sure they're insured by the government .
I'm sure you're right .
I'm not a fan either but I think it would be cool if they did it for mobile .
I'm not sure what you mean by spend wisely , but I agree with your sentiment .
I think it's a reference to the fact that he's been in the company for so long .
I'm sure you would , but it's not like she has to be a guy or anything ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not but I think that's a good point .
They beat Kansas .
I think you mean 3 of them , but I'm not sure .
I'm on it . I'll be back in a few days with more info .
I'm sure he's a good guy but I don't think he should be allowed to do this .
I'm not sure if it's wise , but I do know that it is delicious .
I think they're cute .
Oh yeah ! That's right . I forgot about that .
Same here . I've been using it for a while and never had any issues with it .
Yeah I agree with you there . It's a great way to get people interested in the sport and keep them coming back for more .
I'm not sure if you're being serious , but it's actually pretty common for buildings to wobble during typhoons .
I think it's spelled Dwyane
I've seen that one , but I don't think I could handle the music . It was too loud .
It's not , it's from the movie The Interview .
I'm not sure , but I think that's what they're going for .
I'm at day 2 and it's still not over ! Keep going !
I watched it because I was bored and wanted to see what would happen if they did a movie about this .
It's not like he was the only one who got it right ...
I've done it before , and I'm not even sure what they're looking for .
Nope . I'd go with the noodles .
I'm glad you like it :D
I'm not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing ...
I'm not saying he's bad but he's definitely not the best in the business .
I'm sure he'll get paid , but I doubt he will be able to afford the flight .
I think it was a joke , but I'm not sure ...
I've seen it , but I don't remember him being that bad in it .
I'm going to try and get in as soon as possible !
I'm sure you can find someone with the same name on the internet , but I don't know how easy it would be to do .
Rocos contract expires in 2018 .
I've had it crash once or twice , but I'm not sure what the cause is .
I think it's more of a reminder to not be afraid .
I think it's more that they want to make sure the film doesn't look like a movie .
I'm a 1.5 k buddy . I've been doing it for years and have never had any problems with my friends or family .
I'm not sure if that's a reference or not ...
You're a good man , u davethepenguin !
It's a bit further than that . It's in the middle of nowhere .
It's not a phone , it's a tablet .
He was fouled on the shot .
I have a galaxy s7 edge and it's still pretty slow for me , but I'm on android so maybe that's why ?
Like a man eating a sandwich with his hands on his hips .
I'm on it . Thanks for the heads up !
I think you mean Playoff Harden CP3
I think it's just the angle of the picture , but yeah , she was pretty stressed out .
Because the refs were incompetent .
I'm not judging you , but it was a good idea at some point in time .
I'm not saying it's impossible , I'm just saying there are better ways to do this than moving money around .
I think you mean a long jump abomination , but I'm not sure what that means ...
I'm sure it'll be fine , but I'd like to see a new client that's not just a rebranded version of the old one .
I did this once , and it was awesome !
I think he means Medivh , but I could be wrong .
I think it's more about his views on immigration and how he treats refugees .
I agree with you on that one .
I think it's that you're not getting the full value of your money back from Microsoft .
I think you mean South Africa .
I'm not sure if I agree with that statement but I'll take your word for it .
I'm from Seoul too !
SBB , but I'm biased .
You should ! He's a great writer .
I'm not sure what that means .
He's not a good coach , but I think he has some of the best players in the league .
I'd say save him . He's been pretty good lately .
I'm not sure what you mean by that ...
I'd take that trade in a heartbeat .
Who is he ?
He was on the team for like 2 months before leaving .
You can't get badges from snapchat , but you can get them on the official app .
I'd rather not lose .
I'm sure the US has a lot of people who believe it's not real .
I'm so sorry for your loss of cat .
I agree with you 100 .
Try to open it in a private window and then close it .
I'm okay with this .
I don't have one , but if you find it let me know .
I think it's a toss up between Rodgers and Brady .
He's a good boy . He just likes to play with his toys .
It's the same thing , but with a different color .
It's a good thing they're not , then !
You're welcome ! I hope you have a great day !
I've been meaning to read it for a while now !
It was the way he said it . I'm not sure if that's what you meant , but it definitely sounded like something he'd say to me .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think that's a pretty good percentage for the whole team .
You're not supposed to eat it .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think that's a joke .
I slept in my car .
You're not wrong , but I think you should be more specific .
They're all English .
I agree , but I think it's a good idea to have the option for both accounts .
It's not quiet . It's a dark room with no windows .
I got a bedile too !
I've been playing since the beginning of the year and I'm pretty sure I've watched every event .
I was just thinking that ! I'm only 25 , but I remember it being pretty cool .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say here ...
Melo is a man , he's not going to be able to get any younger .
It's a gif , not a video .
Football is pretty big here , but it's not as popular as hockey or skiing .
I'm not saying she's trash , I'm just saying that the character design isn't great .
I'm not sure if you're being serious but I think that was a joke .
I'm pretty sure she's going to be a playable character in Legion , but I don't think she'll be playable at all .
I use a 20g needle , but I've never used a 25g needle before so I can't comment on that one .
I think so . It's not too hard to do if you have the right gear and know how to use your bike .
I'm with you on that one , I just don't see how they could have made this movie any better than the first two movies .
They're just trying to make money off of their IPs .
I think you mean better .
She's a good actress and I think she has some great chemistry with the cast .
They're going to have to play a lot of games against LeBron before they can win the east .
I'm sure they were all on their way to work .
I'm going to try that , thanks !
I've been doing it for years and never had an issue with mine .
I think you mean the Chiefs are the best team in the league .
I'm not sure what the difference is between that and paying with cash . I've never had an issue with it , but I don't know how often they do it .
I was waiting for her to get out of the car and walk away , but she didn't . I was so disappointed .
It's not a secret if you're telling everyone about it !
I've had that happen to me before . I was so happy when it finally fell apart .
It's a joke ...
I'm not sure . I think it's a good thing that I don't have any money right now .
KD and the Thunder
I'm pretty sure it's not . I've seen the movie , but I don't remember any unions in it .
They're not single . They're just single .
I'd love to have them . PM me !
You can't , you're a fan of both teams and have to pick one or the other .
I think you're in the wrong sub .
I don t know , I like the guy and he s a good fighter but he just doesn t seem very likable .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but that's a pretty good way to describe it .
I'm not sure if that's what he meant but it sounds like the same thing to me !
I'm going to be so disappointed if it doesn't work like that .
I'm sure they'll be fine , but it would be nice if they could get some help from the US and Canada .
I'm a fan of the look too !
I think it was more of a tribute to the fact that they were able to take over the world and make it their own .
I'm glad you got a break .
I'm in the Midwest too , and I've never seen a snow storm that wasn't at least a little bit cold .
I'm pretty sure that's what it is . I've never seen a Starbucks in my life , but I've heard of them before .
I'm pretty sure that's not true ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that you think it's gross ...
I'd be happy to take that offer if you're willing to pay shipping and handling .
The moon is a sphere and there are no planets in it .
It's a great video , I'm glad you enjoyed it !
I've heard it both ways , but I'm from the UK so I don't really care .
It's a great photo !
Life goes on and on my friend !
You're a beast .
He was pretty good today though .
I agree with you on this one !
You're not alone there !
I'm sure it's fine for the fish to eat .
I thought it was a good movie , but I didn't think it was very good .
Thanks man ! I'm ringing now
I'm not getting it either , but I don't think that's a bad thing .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but he's actually the protagonist in the movie .
I'm not sure if that's true or not ...
There are some decent mice out there that are pretty cheap and can be used for gaming .
Han is about 30 years older than Luke .
I think you mean the Disney version of Cinderella 2 : The Secret of the Lost Belle .
I think he's going to be gone after next season .
Same here , but it was a blue orb .
I'm not being negative , I'm just saying that it's not the same thing .
I think it's a word I've never heard before either !
It is in New York , but it's not a state .
I've been there before and it was great !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but ND has a pretty good record against us this year .
I'm not sure what that has to do with anything , but okay .
I'm American and I care .
He was a vegetarian .
I think you mean the 990 , not the 900 .
I think he's been pretty good this season .
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but if you're talking about the US then yes , he's a state .
More aerodynamics .
I think it's more that he was a bit more serious and less silly than the other characters .
I'm sorry , but that was the best movie of the year for me .
I'm sure you can pull a rainbow on the next banner .
They're legal in California and New York .
I think he's just short for his height , but he is still a giant .
I'm pretty sure it's just a big ball of gas .
I think you're confusing this sub with r hiphopheads , where the majority of people here are fans of both of those songs .
He's a pretty big deal in the music industry and he's been around since the early 2000s .
You're not alone .
You'd be surprised .
I'm a big fan of his too !
That's a good one . I'm going to use this from now on .
I think that's the point . He was probably just trying to get a win and didn't realize it would be so hard for him to get one .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think he's actually the most likely candidate for the job .
Rikara's been doing well . She was in a match with Asuka and won .
Hammond's a robot , he can't be human .
I'm not a hype man . I just like to be hyped for things .
You can't just ask for a disc and expect them not to give you one .
I think he's trying to make a joke about how it looks like the screen is covered in dust .
It's a gif , not an animation .
That's a lot of money for a car that doesn't even have a steering wheel !
Omlette du fromage !
Or the first Matrix film .
I'm not sure about that , but I know they do in the midwest .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I'll take your word for it .
Steve is the one who knocks .
I'm not sure what you mean by back to 100 but I'll try again later today when I get home from work . Thanks for reporting !
I'm sorry , I didn't realize it was a blowout until after the 4th quarter .
I'm still waiting for the day when they have a good match on Raw and it's not a squash .
I'm not sure if I should be impressed or horrified ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is the top comment ...
It's a great game !
I think it's more about how she's not as good at being a friend and a confidant as Laura .
I think it's just a sign of stress , not depression .
I think they're both about the same age .
I think it's a good idea . It would make for an interesting story .
I think it's just that she's not attractive enough for the job .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I love that album .
He's a rookie . He'll learn .
I'm sure you'd be able to find some kind of excuse for her .
I got a little bit of a crush on the guy who played the sheriff in that show .
He's been playing well .

The team that has more yellows .

He's also done a lot of voice overs for other shows , like The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones .
I agree . I think it's just too much of an advantage for one team to have .

It's a common thing in Sweden and Finland .
I think that's what happened . He didn't want to get caught out and die .
He's not bad at all . He just doesn't have the speed or strength to be a good corner .
I'm sure they're just going to be sold out by the time the event starts .

I think he means that the calendar is a bit too long , but I could be wrong .
What's a potato ?
I've been riding it for a few years now , and it's still great !
I'm not your son , but I'll take care of you when you're older .
I think you mean Senegal , not Senegal .
I do . I'm a big fan of waving at people and stuff , but I don't really care about being recognized as a minivan driver .
That's what I was thinking !
I think they got it from the tax bill , not the contract .

He's not fasting , he's fasting .
I'd rather have the 996 GT3 , but I'm not complaining .
I think they're talking about the last lap of the race , which was a bit more than half a second faster than the average lap time for the race .

He's not elite , but he is a solid backup . He has been playing well for us this year .
I think he's just trying to get a good deal on it .

I think you're right , but I'm not sure how much that matters to the point at hand .
I'm from Georgia and I've never heard of this place before .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing ...

I'd buy that for a dollar !

Because it's not worth that much to me and I don't want to spend more money on something I can get at Walmart or Target .

Miami is very overrated and LSU is very underrated .
A large titanosaurus is the only thing that could make me want to play this game again .
You're not a homer .
I got a grey one as well . I'm not sure if it's just me or if they're all different colors though ...
It's not a ban on face covering , it's a ban on the use of face covering clothing .

Hulu is great !
Can you pm me too please ? Thanks in advance .
I'd watch that .

I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've heard that's what people do in order to play online games on the Switch .
You could always use a syringe .

I'm not sure what you're talking about but I'm going to take a look at your post history now .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this is the first time I've ever heard someone say that .
I'm sorry , but it's not an article . It's a blog post .
He was clearly out , but it's a good thing that the refs didn't blow the whistle on that one .
That's a good one ! I'm listening to that right now , too .
I've never heard that before ...
I'm not paying for it , but I do have a few friends who are and they're all saying that it's worth it .
It's a plant , but not a tree !

I'm not sure if you're being serious or not but I've never heard anyone say this .

I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing ...
You should , it's a good thing you're not in charge of anything .
I'm Russian and I've never heard of it .
I did , but it's still a good thing to do .
It's a joke . It's just a prank bro !
I'm sure there is plenty of room for improvement in the game , but I don't think it's news to say that they're not working on anything .
I'm sure they will , but I don't think they'll do anything about it until the end of the world cup .
I'm not sure if that is true or not but I think it is .
I think that's because the top part of the picture is a bit darker than the rest .
I'm in the same boat . I'll be at work at 5:30 pm , but I can't wait until it's over !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but that's actually a pretty good joke .
I think you're on to something .
I think it's more that they're not playing well . They've been playing great defense , but they're just not hitting shots .
I think he's a good coach but I'm not sure if he's a great fit for our team .
I think they are trying to make us watch less shows .
I agree , but I think it's more about how much money they've spent on drugs than what they're doing with their lives .
I'm not sure if you're being serious , but I think that's just a codex thing .
Because they're rich .
I thought he was pretty good , but I didn't think he was that great of a character .

I'm not sure , but I think it's a good idea .
I'm not saying they're better , I'm just saying that Gurley has been playing well for a while now .
I'm not sure if you're serious but I think it's a joke about how she was in the same room as Moira when they were talking about the twins .
I mean , they did lose to CLG and TSM ...
You can still do that , but you have to be in a party chat and not just a normal one .
I was thinking the same thing , but I think he's just a little too busy with his own business and not enough time for this .

I'm sure he's just joking around , but I think it was more of a joke than anything else .
I think it's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski , but I'm not sure .
I've never heard of it but I'm going to check it out now ! Thanks for the recommendation !
I think he is just a bit more aggressive .
RemindMe ! 7 days
I'm sure they'll get there eventually . I just hope we don't have to wait for decades .
I think it's because they're not stickied yet , but will be soon .
You can't . They're not allowed in the stadium .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think that's a quote from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy .
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by that ...
I'm on PS4 but thanks anyway !
I'm sure they would have no problem with that .
Fortnite is free , but the game isn't free .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but that's a great idea !
I've been playing it for years and I'm still not sure if it's worth the money or not ...
I'm sure they were just trying to make a profit on their new coal plants .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that I got this reference .
He's been great , but I think he'll be a bit more consistent .
I'm from Long Island too !

I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that I got a good laugh out of this comment .
It's not like she's a doctor or anything ...
I think it's more like a spectrum of sexual orientations .
They excel in their ability to make a joke .
I thought they were just trying to get a good view of the action .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote you for this comment ...

I'm in .
I'm not crying , I just want to see a good game .
I'm interested in the results !
It's instinctual for the Jedi to use lightsabers , but not for the Sith to use them .

I'm sure they're all paid by the government , and not just some random guy who's been on the internet for too long .
I think they're all on Netflix .
I think it's because he was playing on console .
I read them all . I just don't care about the content .
I think he'll be fine in the playoffs . He just needs to get his confidence back up .
We don't .
I don't know , but I'm sure there's some way to get around that .
Same here ! I've been waiting since launch day for a new level .
I'm going to go with Fisto .
I think he means best overall , not best in terms of handles .
I thought she looked like a young Sarah Jessica Parker .
I think he has beef with all of them .
They're not wearing them . They're just there .
You're not wrong ...
It's not tinnitus if you're hearing it . It's just tinnitus .
I'm talking about the game itself , not the community .
I'm not looking back . I'm going to be a man and have no regrets about it .
He'll be a beast , but it will be hard for him to get the ball in his hands when we have no one else to throw to .
It is , and the people are much nicer than New York .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not but they are delicious and very healthy .
I think he's just a little bit too young .

The one that lost to the Lions .
I'm going to get the Pixel XL , but I'll probably end up with a Nexus 6P .
I think the trade is for a player who can't play defense and has no offensive game .
I think it's more likely they were trying to get a good deal on the project .
It's a good thing they're not in charge of marketing then , right ?
I have a lot of free time , but it's not like I'm going to be working for a living or anything ...
I think it's a good idea . I'm sure she'll be remembered for her time in power , but not as a national anthem .
I'm sure it was a great day for you !
I think he's too old for that .
She's a real human bean
It's not like they're going to be riding him anyway ...
I'm pretty sure the best sniper is a shotgun .
Scholes and Gerrard .
I'm not sure , but it's probably the same way you would if you were working on a car .
I would probably be a robot .
He's averaging like 30 a game this year though ...
I feel you , man .
I agree with you on that one !
They're not used to playing against the same team as us .
Alan wake is a great game though !
I'm not American and I've never heard that phrase before .
I'm sorry to hear that , I hope she's doing well !
I think he's retired already , but I'm not sure if it was for the same reason as this one .
I'm pretty sure that's what they were going for .
I think it's the lighting , I'm not sure either .
I'm sure the convenience fee is included in the price , but I don't think it's included in the cost of the service .
I think he's just tired from the last game . He was pretty good in the first half of the season though .
I think he finished it .
TSM and not making it out of groups
It's a great show . I'm surprised you didn't get teary eyed at all !
I'm not sure if that's true , but I've never heard of a state where you can't leave the hitch on .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think it's funny that you're getting downvoted for this .

I'm not American , but I did get one of those messages .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it's a joke .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is the top comment .
I was thinking about that too , but then I remembered that they're not actually sheep ...
I've never had that happen , but I'm sure they would if they could .
He's not a villain . He's a hero .

I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but that's actually pretty funny .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think that's a pretty good thing to say .
I'm from Ireland and I've never heard that term before ...
Rakan is a great pick for EU , I don't think he's bad at all .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote you ...
I'm not sure if that's a reference to something or just an observation ...
Because he's not actually 6 ' 3 , but rather 6 ' 4 .
Jesus was a Jew ?
I've been flying for years and I still have no idea how to get out of the plane without getting hit by something .
I think they're just trying to get a reaction out of the crowd , but I agree that they're annoying .
You mean you didn't have a warthog ?
I'm pretty sure that was a joke ...
I think it's a reference to the song'The Devil Went Down To Georgia'by the band The Killers .
I've never seen one in my life and I play him every game .
I thought that was a bit odd too .
I'm not sure if I want that or a blowout win .
I'm going to do that today , too !
I'm pretty sure that's what happened with the first season of The Office .
I think you mean the B1G .
You're not sorry ?
I think it's a good idea , but I don't know if she'll be able to handle it .
You must be new here ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that you're right about this ...
Same here . I'm still playing through the story , but I've been enjoying this game so far !
He's also a good boxer .
It's a snake .
I'm not a fan of either , but I can see why some would find them funny .
I think so . He was in the air when he touched it and then went down .
He's also in The League .
We'll take them off your hands for you .
I've never been there either ! But I'm sure it's a great place to visit if you're ever in the area .
I'm not worried . I just want to know what the best way is for me to get a job and start my own business .
I think it was , but they were still sponsored by the team .
That's what I do , but it doesn't work if you're lactose intolerant .
I'm with you on this one .
It's not easy to change , but it is very hard to enforce .
I think he's just a little bit of both .
I would love that ! Thanks so much !
I think it's a good idea . I don't want to see players get hurt or anything like that , but if they do , then we should be able to call it .
Oh , okay ! Thanks for clearing that up !
They were pretty good in the first race , but they got worse as the season went on .
You can't wear plate on your hunter . You have to use a different set of armor .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I like it !
I'm going to try and get some more info on this , but I don't think so .
I'm sorry for your loss .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say here ...
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but I agree with your statement .
I loved that movie . I was so sad when it ended .
I think it's still broken , but the police are working on fixing it .
Because they're not a good team and are going to lose to an unranked team .
I agree , but I think the point is that it's not an option for officers .
Or the new one that's being built in Austin .
I'm not sure I follow your question .
I'm in the midwest and have never had more than 100gb a month .
I'm not your amigo , brosephus .
You're not alone , I was too sober for a few days after the incident and I can't recall anything .
I'm pretty sure they're just hired to be there for the holidays .
I'd pay for that .
I think that's a good point . I wonder if they're just for the sake of keeping her from getting out of hand , or if it's more about protecting herself ...
Needs more racism and xenophobia .
I'm pretty sure he's going to win a ring with you guys .
The girl is the teacher , and the boy is the student .
I did forget Portal 2 . I'm not sure if it counts as a game though since it's not on Steam .
I'm sure there's a few . I've seen some videos of people doing it in the past and it seems like it would be pretty easy .
I'm sure he'll be fine , but it's still a good reminder that you should never fly with your eyes closed .
I have a few more , but I'm not sure if they're all in the same place .
I'd be interested in this as well !
I'm picturing a town full of people who have been living there for years and still don't know what it is .
And they got to play against SKT .
I think it was more than 2 rounds , but yeah that's a pretty big difference .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that I got this reference .
I think it's more that they don't know who he is .
TL vs RNG is going to be a great match .
You're still a disappointment though ...
I'm not sure if you're serious , but the warframes are actually pretty good .
I'm sorry to hear that , but you're not dead yet !
I'm sure it's a good thing , but I don't think it's a collector item .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote you ...
I'm not your father , son .
He was good last year too .
I think that would be too much of an overreaction to make a movie about a group of people who were dead for years .
They were chanting CM PUNK ! at the end of the show .
I'm not sure if this is a joke or not ...
I think it's a good game , but I'm not sure if it's a good match for the crowd .
I'm in the same boat , I've had to wait for a few weeks now and it's still not good enough .
I'm the one with the pencil .
I'm sorry , I didn't know that . I'll delete the post then .
I'm going too !
Yes please !
I've been using this for years , works great !
I'm happy , but I don't think we're going to win the East this year .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote you for this comment ...
I'm sure he's got a lot of other things going on in his life , but I don't think it's fair to say that he'll be dead by the time he gets there ...
I'm going with upvotes , because I think it looks cool and I like the idea of a giant robot fighting giant robots .
I'd go to that .
I'm sure they'll be fine .
I'm a senior in high school .
I think that's a reference to the movie , not the book .
I think you mean worse than Joe Lombardi .
Because they're the ones who have to pay for it .
I'm in the same boat . I've been playing since beta and have only gotten to Plat 3 .
I'm not blaming anyone , I was just saying that it is possible to be a victim of bugs and still have fun with the game .
No , but if the Yankees win , then yes .
I think you mean 3 years .
Roma has been pretty good .
He was in a group with Froome and Contador .
Or a dog who's been trained to not bark at people .
Glaz has a gun that can collat .
I'm pretty sure they're just trying to make it seem like he's better than MJ , but he is not .
I think they'd take that trade in a heartbeat .
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
It was a joke ...
I think it's more of a shoulder thing , and the dog has to be able to reach his tail .
I think he's talking about the team not the player .
You can't .
I think it's a good sign that they're moving forward with their plans , but I'm not sure if this means anything for the future of the team or what .
It does . It's just not as good as an ethernet adapter .
I think he's going to be the main antagonist in season 2 .
Because it's not really an experiment , it's just a demonstration of how erosion can happen over time and is very dangerous .
I'll take the chips .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing ...
I'm pretty sure that's what they're doing now .
I'm sure they'll be in the next episode .
I think it's more that they're not as good at drafting as other teams .
That would be cool , but I think it's too much of a hassle for the player to do .
I'm not really into music , but I like listening to podcasts and stuff on my phone .
I have a spider that is bigger than my house .
I'm from California too !
I'm from Sweden and we have a similar system .
RemindMe ! 1 Year
I'm having the same problem , I've tried everything but nothing works .
I'm sure she's a great person , but I don't think she'd be able to pull off the look of disapproval .
Thanks , I'll send you a message .
I think that was the first time I ever saw him win a round .
I'm not sure if I can do that , but I'll try it out and see what happens ! Thanks for the suggestion !
This is the best advice I've ever heard for this .
I think he means solid plane flock .
I'm not forcing anything . I just want her to be happy .
Yeah I'm not sure what that was about but he definitely didn't look like he wanted to be there .
Not really , no . It's a pretty mild pain though .
I think it's because he was the VP candidate in 2012 .
I'm in the same boat . I've been looking for a way since last night , but no luck yet ...
He was also the best shooter on the team last year and he's still not even close to being the best shooter on the team .
I'm not Saudi but I've heard it's a lot more common than you think .
I think it's more of an observation than anything else , but I agree that it does look like something someone would have thought about in their shower .
I'm praying for the return of the old gods and new !
Top 5 in the West , but I'm not sure if that's what you meant by playoffs .
I think he's talking about the last fight , not the first one .
I think you mean u stumblinbear
I think you mean u stumblinbear
He looks like he is playing with a lot of energy .
I thought the same thing , but I guess that's what makes it so good !
I think he meant to say conversing , but I could be wrong .
Can i have the link please ?
I'm a fan of Italian dressing and garlic sauce .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think that's what happened with Paige .
Because they're not big enough to have a large audience .
I've been looking at some of these , but I'm not sure if they're what I want to wear with a suit or not ...
I'm with you , man !
I'm sorry I didn't mean to offend you .
He's not poor enough to be in debt .
I think you're right about that . I don't really have any friends who play video games so I can't really relate to this experience .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that we beat you guys in the playoffs ...
Because it's not a good idea to have a system that is only available to people who are already rich .
I'd like one !
They did but they were still under investigation .
I thought it was a picture of Luke Rockhold too !
I think you mean F 35 , but yeah , I agree with your point .
I think you should just let them go . They're not worth it .
He's not even close to being as good as Harden , but he's definitely up there .
I'll take that bet !
I'm glad you enjoyed it , I thought it was a bit longer than that but I couldn't find anything else to put in there so I just cut out the video .
I'm not arguing political views , I'm arguing that the majority of people who are against it don't have any real arguments for why they should be allowed in .
I'm not saying it isn't entertaining but there are other things to do in my city than watch football games .
I think they're just sitting in their seats .
I'm not sure if I should be scared or excited to fight that thing ...
I want to be a napkin too !
Because it's fun for them .
I'm going to try it tomorrow . I'll report back with my findings .
I'm not sure what you mean by that ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think it's funny that you are downvoted because of your username .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I've seen a lot of people call their phone numbers .
I'm in the same boat , but it's because my apartment is tiny and I don't have a dishwasher .
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry at that thought ...
Ornn is a beast .
You're a bad troll .
I think it's a bit of both , but I agree that the refs are terrible .
Same here , but it's a different venue .
I've played it , but I'm not a fan of the art style . It's too cartoony for me .
I'm sure they could find a way to make it work .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think that's exactly what happened .
I'm sure he was a very good man .
I'm pretty sure he's going to be a villain .
I'm sorry to hear that .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote you ...
I'm from Portland and I've never seen one in person .
I love cheesecake too !
I thought it was the opening to the movie .
I'm not sure what you're getting at here ...
I'm sure you'd have a great time !
I think he's the best player on that team but I don't know if he can carry a game with his playstyle .
I was thinking more like a group of kids who are all in high school and have no idea what's going on .
I think it's more of a rivalry between teams that play each other .
I've had to use one of those things before and it's not that bad . It's just a little loud .
I think it's a good price for the quality of the watch , but not sure if that's what you're after .
Because you're not sleeping enough , duh !
I'm on Xbox too ! Add me : TheRealDankMuffin
I've seen it happen to me . I was surprised that I didn't get hit by the ult .
I'm sure you can find some rock removal tools in your basement .
I'm pretty sure that's what they were going for too .
I'm pretty sure it was both .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I'll take it as a compliment .
I'm not sure if she is a handful but she definitely has a lot of energy and will be very happy to have you join us in our new home .
I think you guys are going to be fine with just having two safeties .
I'm not sure what that is . I've never had it before , though .
I thought it was pretty funny , but the ending was just so bad .
I think he was just trying to get a yellow for dissent , but it didn't work out that way .
I think you mean the Jets are the Browns'joke .
I think it's more like a combination of both .
Klopp is resting him for a reason . He's not fit enough to play in the CL .
I think it's more like they were friends for years , then one day they just kinda fell out of touch .
She's a good cat .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ... but I think that's a pretty good analogy .
I'm sorry for your loss .
I'm sorry , but you're not the only one who's been bamboozled here .
Because it is .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think he was referring to the fact that he didn't play in the first half of the season .
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I think you're confusing me with someone else who said they don't mind the price .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think it's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski .
It was a fake .
He was probably just trying to get his car out of the way so he could get away from the cops .
Zen is my favorite too .
It is relevant to the people that are actually watching football , and it is also relevant to those who follow soccer in general .
That's awesome ! I'm glad you're doing better now , but it was a long time ago .
I'm sure she did that on purpose .
Same here , but I'm at chapter 4 now ...
I agree with this sentiment 100 .
He's been pretty bad all year , and it's not just this game . He's been awful for the last 3 years .
I'm glad you're feeling better , I hope your day gets better too !
I'm not sure what that is but I will definitely do it ! Thanks so much !
And my bow !
I'm not going to leave it . I'll be sure to eat it though !
I'm sure you're a nice guy , but that's just not true .
It's not you .
It's a great game if you like RPGs and have a lot of time on your hands .
That's what I do too .
It's a joke about the fact that it was posted on r todayilearned and not r todayilearned
I got her too , but she is only 6 star .
Dook is the worst .
No problem , thanks anyway
Thanks , I'll do that !
The Browns have a lot too .
I do . I'm a fan of the game , but I don't think it's that great .
I'm not sure what you mean by that .
I'm from Boston and I can confirm this .
I think it's more likely that they'd move it back to Detroit , but I could be wrong .
They've been doing that since the beginning of the show .
7 . Chelsea
I was just about to say the same thing lol .
I'm 23 and I've been dead for a while now ...
I'm sure they were all thinking about how much they loved LeBron and wanted to see him win .
I know that , but I was referring to her build .
I'm going to use this one .
I think he'll be back for Summit 2 . He said that he'd like to do it again at some point .
I would buy one of those and wear it to the game .
I'm not saying they aren't good but that's just ridiculous .
His defense and rebounding are also pretty good .
I'm sure they'll be fine , it's just a prank bro !
I'm sure you could have done better , but that's still pretty cool .
I'm sure it did , but I don't think it's been used as an excuse for anything yet .
I'm sure you're right . I hope we can get some good players for our squad .
I'm not sure what you mean by this , but I'll take your word for it .
I'm sorry to hear that , but you're going to be fine !
I don t know about that . They both have good teams around them .
He's in the locker room .
I'm not sure if I should be worried or excited about this ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think that's a pretty good idea actually ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that he's gone .
I think they're trying to make us use the dark mode for a while longer .
You should probably get that checked out , man !
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing ...
Awesome thanks for the info !
I think you have to be in a certain area of the map . I'm not sure though , sorry !
He's not allowed to drive in the street because of the HOA .
He's a legend .
I think it's the fact she was holding a camera .
You're right , I should have been more careful with my diet .
I think it's about the same as a normal person .
He's on IR with a shoulder injury .
I'd say that's a fair point . I'm just saying that it's not like we're going to get any more players in the next few years .
I think it was more of a satisfying death than a satisfying death , but I'm not sure .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but that's the correct pronunciation of the word .
I'm 5 ' 11 and I hate it when people call me short because I'm so tall .
I'm a kid and I still don't understand what's going on .
He's not a husky . He's a labradoodle .
You would be surprised how many people do .
I'm not , but thanks for the tip !
I'm not denying anything , I'm just saying that it is not a good thing to do .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote you for this comment ...
Jeff Green is playing tonight .
Don Cheadle is the man .
He is good but not world class . He has been playing in the Eredivisie for years now .
He had 2 accounts , but he was only playing on one of them .
I've used it in a few games . It's not that bad .
I use a piece of paper towel .
This makes me smile .
I think it was a combination of both .
I think it's a horse .
I'm not sure what you're talking about , but I think it's pretty clear that the Tauren were involved with the Nelfs .
I'm an MD . I don't eat carbs or fats . I just drink lots of water .
Facebook is already a thing of the past .
I'm not sure . I think you should ask the mods , but I'm not sure how they would respond .
I think they were the best in the world .
I think it was a joke .
I think he's talking about the guy who got in there and started the whole thing .
I remember that too ...
You're gonna need more than that .
I think that was a mistake .
I'm not sure what you mean by that ...
I think that's what they were trying to say , yes .
Perfectly balanced , as they should be .
Still down for me too ...
I live in Melbourne , Australia . I don't get it .
I think you mean golf score , not score .
I've heard good things , but haven't gotten around to reading it yet !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but it's a good thing he's president because he'll be able to do more than just talk .
I think so ... but I'm sure he would've been happy with the tip anyway .
I'm not sure if you are serious or not , but I hope you aren't ...
I'm not assuming anything , I'm just saying that it's a possibility .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think that's a joke .
Winter War 4 : The Winter War Awakens
I think he's just trying to get her back on track , but I don't know if that will work out .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that he's gone ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is happening ...
You're doing it wrong then !
I'm glad you like it ! I was going to make a few more but I didn't want to overwhelm everyone with my work haha
It's a Steam Link controller , not a Steam Link TV .
I think you're right , I just remember reading that they were going through a lot of dogs and not having enough for all of them .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I agree with this statement 100 .
I've never had a pineapple pizza , but I'm sure it's delicious .
He's from the same city as the other two , but he's not in the main roster yet .
I'm pretty sure that's the point .
I think that would have been a different story .
I'm not sure . I know it was a 5 year deal for him and his wife .
Every game .
My chest hurt just thinking about it !
Because the US is a very poor country and the people who have the most money are not the ones that care about their health .
I'm sure that's what they say about me ...
I'm not sure what you're talking about ... I think he's just saying it's a bad angle to be on .
I'm sure it's going to be a great movie .
I've never had frozen blueberry ice cream , but I'm sure it's delicious !
I think that would be a good idea . I'm not sure if it will happen though .
I think he was just being sarcastic .
You're not a real man , you know that ?
I think it was a good call .
I think it's more that they're both really good at basketball .
I'm not sure if you're serious but I think he's a troll .
! remindme 3 days
And Bad Boys 6 : The Revenge of the Bad Boys
I'd rather have him throw to Sherman than Kap .
I think it's only for the league cup .
I don't think so . I'm not sure what the rule is , but it's a good question to ask in the future .
I was just thinking that .
I'm sure they're not going to be deported , but I'd still like to see them go .
Because it was a catch and he had possession of the ball before the fumble occurred , which is what matters in this situation .
I think he's been great this season , but he's not a starter .
Because they are the only ones who can afford to buy a boat .
That would be so awesome !
I'm sure he's had a lot more than one boss .
I think it was more because of the lack of talent around them .
You're a good person , thanks for doing this !
I'm sorry for your loss .
I think you mean Google Play Music .
I think it's more of a perfume .
I think he's wearing the shirt for his brother .
I think he's too old for Grindelwald , but I'm not sure about Mads .
I think he's going for 50 25 15
I'm not sure what you mean by refactor , but I'll look into that . Thanks !
I would say so . It's a great game , but it's not necessary to play the other games in the series .
I think he's gonna be in the next season of The Walking Dead .
You're a good person .
I have not , but I will now ! Thanks for reminding me of that book .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think it's a joke about how the Packers are going to lose the division this year .
I think they'll be fine , but I don't see them being as good as last year's team .
Because you can't use your phone while in the shower ?
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that he's gone .
I think he was trying to make a joke about how people are complaining that they don't get the full episode because they're on mobile .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think that's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski .
I think it's a free service .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but that's a good idea !
It's a great show , but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen the first season . It gets better .
I'm a plant .
That would be a dream come true !
I'm not sure if he's good or bad . I just think he's a solid player .
It's not a dream , it's a nightmare !
You're the best audience !
I thought it was just one .
I think he's like 40 or something , but yeah , he looks great !
I think it's because they're not very detailed and the colors are too vibrant for his taste .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I laughed pretty hard at this .
They've been trash for a while now .
I'm not saying it doesn't work , I'm just saying that's what happened .
I'm sorry to hear that , but at least they didn't fire you for being a thief !
They're not , but they're still a good way to get the point across .
It's on the front page .
I did but I was told to leave the area .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I like the way you think !
I'm aware , but he's not playing at the same time as the rest of the lineup .
I'm playing it in my mono red aggro deck . I think it's a good card and it's fun to use .
I have a black eye , but I'm not sure if it's the same as having a brown one or not ...
You should have left them in the sun !
Remindme ! 2 months
He was a starter for Miami , he carried them to the finals .
Me three . I'm not even sure if we'll make it past the group stage .
Vegetarianism is the best way to go , no matter what you do or don't eat .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not ... but I think that's a bit of an overstatement .
I'm not sure what you mean by these numbers but they're all in the article .
I was there too , and I was so excited to see it . It's a great movie .
It's a great movie . I think it's the best of the series , and it's definitely worth watching .
Or maybe he'd use the pillow to make a weapon ?
I'm hoping for a Purdue win . I want to see them play in the big ten championship game .
He was in the way .
She's a cat person , not a dog person .
You were number 4242 of Thanos ' 231259 children snapped r inthesoulstone .
I'm not sure if that's a compliment or an insult ...
He's not going , he's just trying to get the media attention so that they can push him into a more favorable light .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think he's actually a Mexican .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I like your username .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not .
That's a good idea , I'll do that too !
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I'll take your word for it .
I think you mean crushed , not crushed .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is a thing now ...
A new car , a house , or a dog .
I'm sure the lawyers would have been able to find them and bring them in for questioning .

I'm fine . I'm fine . I'm fine . I'm fine . I'm fine !
I think it's more that the game is not really about the story , but rather about the gameplay and the world building .

You did ! Thank you so much .
I think he was trying to say it like a pirate , but I'm not sure .
He did have a daughter though , so that counts for something right ?
It's a good movie though .
He's the best at what he does and what he says . He's also the worst at what he doesn't do .
And if you don't get your way , you'll be burned alive .
I'm sure he does it to get the job done .

I'm going to go with the same thing . I think we're gonna get a lot more than 30 .
I think it was a joke about how he's always been known to practice his throws in the backyard .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not .
I think he was trying to get the ball back .
I'm sure they're just for the kids , but I'd still buy them .
I'm sure that's what they'd say if she was smoking a joint in her car .
I think you mean the Kardashians are smart and have a good PR team .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it's a pretty fair assessment .
I'm pretty sure you guys are the only ones who would want that .
That's the dream !
I think it's pretty good . I'm not sure why you're being downvoted though ...
I think he's just hungry .
They're not dead , they just go to sleep .
I have a cat who would do this to me if he could get away with it .
Jesus was a Jew .
The Room .
Definitely would be better .
I'd pay to see that .
I think he was blind before he got his powers and then he became a superhero .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not .
He's gonna say something like , I'm not a wrestler but I can wrestle !
I think he's a security guard , not a security guard .
I'm sure they're not , but it's still a good idea for people who want to know what's going on in the game .
I think it's a good trade for both teams .
I'm sure they'd be all over it if it was a real thing .
I'm not a biscuit , I'm a biscuit !
He's a Rams fan , he knows what's going on .
I'm going to watch it again on Netflix this weekend !
I'm sure he's a great guy and all but that dog was probably just hungry for some food .
Extra time .
I'm sure he's fine , but I think it would be a good idea to check the foam insulation before you do anything like that .
I think it's two now .
They'll probably have a whole new season of it , but I'm not sure what they're gonna do with it .
I've been using Whatsapp for years and never had a problem with it .
I'm not sure what the point of this comment is , but I agree with it .
I'm not sure , but I think the title is misleading .
The French and losing to Germany .
I'm American , but I've never heard of that sub .
I'm sorry , but she's not interested in me anymore .
Yes please ! Thanks so much for the offer , but I'm going to pass on it now .
I've never had one , but I'm sure it's delicious .
I think you mean , until there's a new guy in SA .
They're not , they're just nominated for their roles in the movie .
I'm a binary person .
I think they were trying to get the enemy team to tilt .
I think the water is a reflection from the camera lens , not a reflection on the wall .
I think it's the hair .
He's a good player , but he's not a great fighter .
I'm not sure what you're asking .
I'm hoping for the same thing !
They're all British .
I'm pretty sure he was a wrestler too , but I could be wrong .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I laughed .
I'm not sure . I think it's more likely that the Russians are just trying to get their hands on some of our secrets .
It's the eyes , man !
I'm guessing a trailer for the game .
I'm not sure if I want that or not ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not but he was elected in 2012 and won by a landslide .
I'm from Sweden too ! I love it !
And my axe .
Zidane is available for a few more years at least .
They're going to be pretty bad , but I think they'll look good on TV .
I don't think so . I'm not sure what the rules are for that , but it's a good idea to try and find out .
Or just use the furnace to make more food and water .
I think he was better than Rekkles in that game .
I'm not sure we're even close to being a good team , but I think we could beat them .
It's a wonderful life is one of my favorite movies ever !
I'm pretty sure you can't even get a fire extinguisher to work on a fire .
I'm a 90 ' s baby . I don't know what you're talking about , but I've never had any of those things .
It's still a good thing though , right ?
I'm a Scot and I approve this message .
He's a professional .
I think that's a good thing , I'm not sure why people are downvoting you for saying something like that .
Thanks for the support !
I do . I'm a big gamer and I've been playing GTA V for the past few days .
Croatia is my favorite team to support !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but that's a pretty good way to describe the symptoms of cancer .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I'll take it as a compliment !
I'm the same age as you and it's my birthday too ! Happy Birthday to us both !
I can't comment on this post because it's private and I don't want to be banned for no reason .
I would just use a USB stick .
I think the point is to make sure you get paid .
That was a great movie , I wish they would make more of them .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ...
Good luck ! I hope you get it sorted out .
RemindMe ! 2 days
I'm not sure if you're serious or not .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that you're right about this ...
I think it's more that they're not making it to worlds , but I could be wrong .
I'm not sure what that has to do with anything . I've been sleeping well and have had plenty of sleep .
I'm pretty sure that's not true , but I could be wrong .
I was waiting for it to happen .
I think that was a mistake , but I'm not sure .
I think you mean liquid diarrhea , but yeah .
Same here . I got a Lugia and a Hoopa .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ...
Peeta is a better actor .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing ...
I love that song !
I'm not sure , but it's a good question .
I'm sure you're joking but that's actually a real name .
I think it's more like she was trying to get a reaction out of the employee .
I've heard good things about the one on the corner of the river from the airport .
I'm in California too . I pay about 4.50 a gallon for regular unleaded .
I think it's just that the parties are so different , and they're not really comparable .
I agree , but it's not a bad idea to have some sort of PvP mode that is more focused on movement than combat .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I've never heard of it .
I'm sorry to hear that . I hope you can find a new place soon !
I like this rule , it's a good one to use when talking about the subject of a sentence .
I'm Canadian and I play hockey .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've been using libgen.io since the beginning of time . It's great .
I've never had either of those places ... but I'll keep it in mind for next time !
I think the name was called something like The Last Kisses of the King , but I could be wrong .
He's been awful for a while now .
I think he's gonna be bald and have a beard that looks like a wig .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it was a joke ...
Or just give him a bow and arrows , like in FE : Awakening .
I'm from MI and I've never seen one .
He was arrested in Italy , not Malta .
I agree , but I think it's a good idea for people who want to play on their own difficulty .
I'm not sure if I can do that with my current job .
I'm not offended .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but that's actually a really good point .
I'm glad you're safe !
I think that was a reference to the movie , not the book .
I think he was talking about how he had a hip injury and couldn't walk properly for a while after that .
Patrick Wilson was a great actor , I think he's underrated in this role .
i'll add you to the list !
I'm sure you'll find a way . I've been making it for years , but I just don't have the patience or time to do it every day .
Because we're not playing the best team in the country .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think he's joking about how Trump is going to make America great again .
It's a toyota . It's not illegal to drive it on the road .
I don't know , it's a pretty good idea .
I'm thinking it's gonna be a henchman .
I'm not even mad .
I think it was a joke , but I'm not sure .
I'm glad too , but I was just thinking that it's a bit odd to have someone be so careless with their pets .
I'm still watching the movie , but I've never seen it . I'll have to check it out !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but it's true that there is no collusion between Trump and Russia .
I think he's a little overweight , but that's just me .
It's not a golden , it's a golden retriever .
You're welcome ! I'm glad you liked it .
It's a chain , so yes .
Fouts is the worst .
I'm in the same boat . I think it's a good move to bring him on .
I'd do that in a heartbeat .
I think she's fine , but I don't think it'll be as bad as people say .
I've been using Sync for a while now . It's great !
I'm glad you enjoyed it !
I thought it was the guy who played the kid in the movie that had a centipede body ?
What's your favorite color ?
I think it was a combination of that and the fact that he had no idea what he was doing .
You're a good person .
I'm not sure if I should be thankful or sad for this idea ...
Because the UK is a big country .
I'm from Maryland too !
I think he's going to be a good slot guy , but I don't see him being a top tier WR .
He's a troll . Ignore him , he's not even funny .
Happy Cake Day to you too !
I'm pretty sure it's a reference to the movie , not the title of the article .
I'm not sure what you're talking about but he's definitely better than LeBron .
I thought it was a picture of him and his wife at first .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but it's a good thing that you didn't make this .
I think it's more that they were down by 20 at one point .
I think you mean'color ' .
That's a paddlin ' !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but that's exactly what happened .
That's a good way to put it .
I'm pretty sure that's just because he's a huge fan of Lovecraft .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ... but that quote is from a movie called The Big Lebowski .
I'm doing well , thanks . How about yourself ?
I'm not familiar with that reference , but it's a great movie !
Because it's a title .
I think they're just getting used to playing against a good offense and not being able to adjust to it .
I'm in CA , but I don't think I've ever seen a single person say anything about voting for Trump or Hillary .
I think that's a good point . I'm not sure why people are so against it though .
You're not going to beat us at home .
I was there for the first half of the match , it's not like they were playing well at all .
I'd watch that .
I would if I could get away with it , but no .
Dr . No U
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is happening ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but that's a great idea !
I think he was just being traded for a reason . He wasn't going anywhere and he wanted to be here .
3 . Being a good teammate and teammate's son
I think it's more that the dinosaurs are gone .
I think he was just trying to get a little revenge on the guy who beat him in the first place .
Or the guy who played the dog in The Big Lebowski .
I don't think he's going to be able to handle the pressure of being a father of two kids .
I'm pretty sure that's a picture of the actual sign , not a signature .
I'm sure you're a great person and all but I don't think that's what happened here ...
I'm not sure what you're getting at , but I'll take it anyway .
We have one , he's just not good enough to be the starter .
We have a lot of corn .
I'm not sure , but I think it's because he's a dog .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think it's a joke .
I've had that happen to me too . I was so mad at them for it and they just kept playing .
They were probably just trying to get out of there before it got too hot and they had to go back inside .
I'm sorry , but you're not allowed to use the word sic in this subreddit .
I think you mean legalize and tax , not legalize and tax .
The Emperor's Children .
I think it's the fact that he has a better passer rating and less interceptions .
He is also the only champion that can be played in any role , so he is basically the best player ever .
That's not what happened , but it was funny to me anyway !
Thanks for the support !
I'm not sure if you're serious but that's awesome !
I think it was just a typo , but I'm not sure .
That's a lot of people !
I'm a Cards fan , but I don't really care about baseball .
You're fine , it's just that you seem to be a bit obsessed with bees .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think that's the joke ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think that's what he was doing .
I think it's more about the fact that the Pats are now a better team than they were in 2007 , but I could be wrong .
He got a concussion .
I think it's a good idea , but I don't know if they'll be able to get the rights for it .
I think that's what he was doing , but I'm not sure .
I'm already there lol
I'm sorry for your loss of money , but at least you got a good game !
I think they're trying to compete with Netflix's content .
I think it's more like , how do you survive a crash ?
I have a dog named Steve and I'm not even sure if he's my real name .
It's not really a scandal if the president is in charge of the country , so no .
I'm going to be so excited !
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
I'm still waiting on the second one .
Yeah , I'm not sure why they did that . It's just weird to me .
I'm not sure what this means , but I like it !
It is . But the people who are going to be accused of this will not be able to defend themselves .
I think it's actually Earnest Ernest .
It's a pretty steep hill , so I'm guessing she didn't even get to the top .
You're on !
I'm not sure what your definition of'salaried'is but I've worked for a few companies where this would be an option .
I'm not sure if this is a joke or not , but I like it .
It's not like they're going to sue us for something that isn't even a law .
I'm a heat fan and I got one of those jerseys .
I think you're right !
The Morker
I'm sure she's not into you .
Yes it did .
I'm sure there are a lot more people who don't have steam or uPlay then .
I'm not sure , but I think it's pretty good . It's got a lot of different flavors .
I think you're onto something .
I'm going to try and get a few more people involved . I'll keep you posted !
Alexis has been playing well , but he's not a starter .
I'm sure you can find some cheap ones on Amazon or eBay .
I think he was just trying to get a good look at Patty .
It's a blanket , it's just folded over .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think that's a bit more than just winning .
I'm pretty sure that's a Jewish thing , not an American one .
It's an American thing .
Sure thing . Thanks for the offer though !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but that's a pretty good idea .
I've got one of these and love it , great gun !
Used it , thanks !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think the hate is mutual .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it's pretty clear that the measles vaccine is not effective against measles .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but it's true .
I'm at 110 and haven't played in about 3 months .
I'm not sure if this is sarcasm or not ...
I'm guessing he's a dog owner , and not a dog person .
I'm pretty sure it was a joke about the fact that she can't hit him with her ult .
I'm pretty sure that's what they did with the first game .
I think so . I've never been there but it seems like it would be a good place for a night out .
I think that's a woman .
I'm sure they have a list of people who are good and bad , but that doesn't mean they're not going to do it .
I'm sure you're not going to be disappointed .
I think he's going to be the next Hoyer .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is the top comment .
Yeah , I'm thinking of doing that too .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think it's a joke about the fact that he's from Barcelona and plays for Barca .
It's like the refs are trying to make up for the missed calls .
I was thinking that too , but I think they were just trying to get a better view of the screen .
I'm sure you could find a way to do this with your mouth , too !
I think he's a good champ , but I don't like him as much as the others .
I'm glad you enjoyed it !
I enjoy them too . But I'm not sure if it's because of the offense or just because they're playing well .
I've never had a problem with it . It's not like you're inhaling smoke from the inside of your mouth or anything .
I think it's more like an admission of guilt .
A place where trucks are sold and not just for the sake of selling them .
I'm not saying it's a bad thing , I just think the idea of a pokemon game with no story is pretty silly .
I've seen it about 10 times now and still laugh every time !
I was going to say that too . I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not but I really enjoyed those movies and I don't know why .
See what you did ?
I'm not even mad .
I'm sure it was a lot of work , but I bet they had some fun with it !
I'm rooting for the Lakers .
Our oline has been pretty solid for a while now , but our d line is just awful right now .
I think it's more likely to be a new character than a new show .
I'm sorry for your loss .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it's a pretty common thing to do in the US .
I'm not a fan of them either but I think they're doing a good job so far .
The Rolling Stones are a great band . I'm not sure about the bowling stoners though , but they're definitely worth checking out !
It is . It's a new character from the upcoming episode .
I'd like to be a millionaire .
And then they'll threaten to cut the gas supply .
It is very fun and has some great atmosphere . It's also a lot of fun if you have friends who like games .
Link please ?
I'm not sure why , but I think it's because of the price difference .
I did ! It was a lot of fun .
I'm good thanks ! I was just thinking about the vampire thing .
I'm a genius !
I'm glad you enjoyed it !
Because he's the only one who can be a face .
The only one I can think of is the one where he's talking about how he was a little bit too excited to be in the room with his son .
I've never heard of him , but I'm sure he's a great guy !
I have a few of those , but they're not very good quality and I don't want to use them for anything .
He pitted at the same time as Bottas and got a penalty for it .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think that's a pretty good analogy .
I think he was trying to make a joke about how he is a big boy and that his dad is a small one .
It's a blast . I'm so excited for the next season !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not .
You're doing it wrong .
I'm in the UK and it was about 20C today , but it was a bit chilly yesterday .
I'll fight you for it !
I'm not sure , but I think they do . I don't know why you're being downvoted though ...
I think it was both .
I think they'll be fine , but if they do , I'm sure they will have to change their name to something like The Shaqtin'a Fool or something .
I think it's a quote from the movie The Big Lebowski , but I could be wrong .
Thanks ! It's a great place , and the view is amazing from there .
It's a joke from the movie .
I'm sure you're right , but it doesn't mean he isn't doing something about it .
Because he's fun , and people like him ?
He's going to sleep , but I'm sure he'll be up for the next few hours .
I'm sure they're just trying to get their revenge on the birdies that stole their food .
Yeah I was just thinking about that one .
I think it was a tie .
He is a black man , so it makes sense that he would try and be seen as white .
That was a great episode !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but that's exactly what happened to me when I switched from an iPhone to a Sony Xperia Z1 .
I'm not a big fan , but I can see why some would be upset about it .
I think it's only if you're a minor .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think it's a good idea to have a monarchy in Canada .
It's not ignoring power projection , but the fact that they're allies with each other .
I think you're right . I'm just saying that's what happened to us in the first half of the season .
You're a monster !
He was also on Silicon Valley , but it wasn't a big deal .
I'm sure they would if it was a threat to their interests .
I'm sure you're right but I don't think that's what he was saying at all ...
It's not like he has a choice in the matter , though ...
I've never heard of either of these terms before ! Thanks for the info !
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that it's true ...
That's what I thought too !
I'm so glad I didn't watch the whole thing , that was hilarious !
I've seen a few on here and I'm not sure if they're real or not but it looks like they're all legit to me .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but he's actually a very good actor and has been in some really great movies .
Done , please return thx .
He's a real dog . He's just not very good at it .
I think he's just trying to get karma by posting the same thing over and over again .
I'm not sure what that means , but I'll take your word for it .
I'm sorry , I didn't know that was a rule . I'll take it down now . Thanks !
He's been getting fouled a lot .
It's a guy in a suit , but he looks like a woman .
I'm in the Twin Cities and I've never heard a crowd that loud .
I'm waiting for a sequel to that one too !
I'm a time traveler !
I feel you bro ...
I'm on the west side of town . I don't know where to go .
It will be a lot more expensive than the current system .
It's on Netflix , if you have that .
Fnatic is a good team , they just have to play better than the other teams .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not .
I think that's a bit more than just one city , but yeah , it's still pretty small .
I'm sure he has a lot of other tricks up his sleeve .
I'd love that , I'll PM you the link when I get home from work tonight . Thanks for sharing this !
I think it's a genetic thing .
He's a good actor , but I don't know if he's that good of an actor .
And then he'll be the next Tom Haverford .
I'm not sure what you mean by that ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or not .
I think he's just trying to get a rise out of people .
I'm paying 1100 for a two bedroom apartment in the city .
I'm thinking the same thing , but I don't know if that's a good idea for her .
I think he's a great actor and I'm glad they went with him for the role .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I like the way you think !
I'm not sure if it is , but I've heard that they can be very damaging to your health and are a lot more expensive than other sports .
I'm fine with it . I don't want to see them play each other again , but if they do , we can just have the game at home .
He's dead .
I'm from Portland and I've never heard of this place !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but it's a bug that happens when someone follows you in the jungle and then leaves .
I think you mean 3rd best record in the league .
I'm sorry . I didn't mean to spoil anything .
That's a good idea , I'll look into that !
I think he was trying to get a picture with the camera .
I was thinking the same thing , but I think it's a young man .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I laughed pretty hard at this .
I'm sure they'll be fine , but it's still pretty bad for them .
I'm in the same boat . I've been trying to get one but no luck so far .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad for them .
His father .
I got nothing either , but I'm sure it's just a bug .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ...
I think it's a good idea . I'm not sure why they're doing it though .
I think the reason is that they're not going to be able to sell out a stadium for a few years , and then they'll have to start over again .
He's still got it !
I think he was trying to get away with a push off on the sideline .
I've been there . It's pretty good , but I prefer Pho King .
You re welcome !
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I just wanted to share my experience with the community , and I thought it was interesting .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but that's a pretty good point .
I think she's going to be a little more careful with her programming , but I'm not sure if that means Dolores will be able to control him .
I'm not sure , but I think they can .
I'm sure it's a lot of people who don't know about the market for bubblers and are just looking for some cheap booze .
I think you mean impossible for us , but I'm not sure about that .
Yeah , I'd be okay with that as well .
Spurs is the team that won't win a title .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say here ...
I'm a fan of the puma logo .
That would be a good idea , but I don't know if it's possible to do that .
I think so . I don't know how much it would help , but if you can get him to do that then yes .
It's a parody of the manga , so it's not really that far off from the anime .
It is a shadow .
And he had a beard !
You are correct !
The NBA is the most popular sport in America , so I'd say that's pretty much guaranteed to be a super team .
I can't even imagine what she could have done with the prequels .
It's a good thing I'm not a lawyer .
I'm pretty sure he was at least 3x bigger than that , and probably more than twice as strong .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing , but it is definitely a good thing !
I liked it , but I'm not sure if it's worth watching . It's a bit more action oriented than the first season .
I'm not sure if that's the best way to go about it ...
It's not like they're going to be able to get out of bed for a few hours anyway ...
I've been playing since the beginning of the year and have yet to find a game that's fun .
I hope it works !
I'm from Idaho and we have no winter . It's always cold and snowy here .
As an American , I'm not your guy , friend .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think that's a pretty good idea actually ...
I'm just here so I can get banned too !
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've read the book and it's pretty good .
I love fondant ! I'm not a fan of the texture though ...
That was me when I saw it on the front page yesterday .
I'm sorry , I don't understand what you're trying to say .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing .
I think they took 2 games , but I'm pretty sure it was a sweep .
I think they'll meet at the Tokyo Dome , but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go there for a show .
I'm pretty sure he's listed as 6 ' 2 on the official website .
I don't think he's going anywhere , but if you're not gonna be there , then you can't be here .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is a thing .
He's a good player . He'll be fine .
I think it's a good idea to have a new season of S13 .
I think you mean impossible because of the lack of a landing pad and all ...
I'm sure he would've made it if he didn't get hit by the defender .
You're a special little chopstick snowflake !
You're not alone , I've been there too !
I'm not sure , but I think it's a good idea to have a separate channel for the streamers and their viewers .
I think that was the last one of the season .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ...
I've never tried it , but I'm sure it's delicious !

Tatar is the name of a region in Russia .
I think you mean conquer the world .
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I think the idea is that they should be able to regulate trade without congressional approval .
He was the one who got the first down on that punt .
I think you mean drain the dumplings .
You can't even see the gun !
I'm sure there are plenty of reasons to doubt it , but that doesn't mean you shouldn't question it .
I think the EU should do more than just show solidarity with Ukraine .
I think it's more like 1.5 billion .
I'm not sure if I should be offended or not ...
He's talking about his teammates .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that I got this reference ...
I think he's the only one who can throw it that far .
They would have been awarded the ball back .
I'm with you on that one , but I don't think we'll be able to do it without a miracle .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ... but I'll take it as a compliment !
I'm not sure , but I think the deer probably got out of its way .
I'm sure they'll be fine .
There are dozens of us ! Dozens !
Yes , but it's not like they're going to win the game .
He's also in a lot of good films .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but it's pretty much guaranteed that both teams will win .
I do this all the time when I'm trying to get a seat in the front row .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this happened .
I think he's learning from his dad . He's been doing this for years .
He was on the radio for a while , I think .
I think it's actually Sir Alec Guinness .
I'm sure he's got some sort of special powers that can't be used by the average joe , but I don't think it'd be too hard to get him down .
You're not alone , I was waiting for that too !
He was just trying to get the last word in .
I'm sure there are some fish out there who would eat us if we were alive .
I agree , I think they should have gone with gold instead of silver .
No , they're still in .
She's supposed to be a bruiser top with 1 2 damage items and tank .
It's a good sign !
I'm not sure I understand the reference . Can you explain ?
He's not buying a house though .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but it's a good thing that we have the best team in baseball to keep us on our toes !
I'm sure they're just using some sort of cleaning agent to remove the dirt and then putting it back in .
I mean , it's not like you can't just walk away from the fight .
I think you mean second best team in the world , not second best team in Europe .
I think it's been pretty good .
I feel like this is a good way to describe it , but I'm also a bit paranoid about my own feelings and thoughts .
I think you mean : We ate all those cheeses , mightiest heroes !
I think you mean a paradox in the universe .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think OP is being sarcastic .
I'm sure he's still in the hospital from that one hit to the head .
I think you mean a blockbuster .
Gus is not a title contender . He's a top 5 guy but he isn't a title contender .
I think he's just trying to get a reaction out of the crowd , but they're not really getting one from him .
He also didn't have the Infinity Gauntlet , which is what made him so powerful .
I'm sure he would have been fine if he didn't get hit in the face with a car .
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
I'm in .
I'm hoping for a good game .
I agree ! I think it's really neat and useful for the future of our world .
I think it's a net toss .
I'm sure they do , but I've never seen one that did .
What's your favorite color ?
I'm not sure what you're trying to say .
It's a good show . It's not as good as the other ones but it's still worth watching .
I'm sure they'll get it right eventually .
I'll take you up on that offer . I'm going to be there in two weeks .
I'd watch it just to see the new guy's face when he gets his head chopped off by a giant robot .
I'm not sure if I should be worried or not , but I'll keep an eye on it . Thanks for your concern !
I'm sorry for your loss .
She was pretty good in S1 though .
I was born there !
I'm pretty sure that's not what happened at all ...
I'm not sure what you're asking .
I'm sure he's still alive .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think it's a reference to the anime series Evangelion .
That's a good one ! I'm going to use that from now on .
The Gulf Coast .
I'm in the same boat as you . It's Friday here too .
That's a good idea too !
I think she's actually a really nice person .
I'm glad you enjoyed it ! I've been wanting to watch it for a while now , but I haven't gotten around to watching it yet .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I've heard of people getting paid more than that for striking .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think that's a reference to the movie Birdman .
He's the Donald Trump of memes .
I loved the first round of Netero vs Meruem .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not but it was a pretty good match .
Not close enough .
I'm not sure I understand what you're saying ...
I'm sure you'll get a good pop for it .
I think he was just trying to get his team some rest .
I'm sorry , I didn't know there was one for this show . I'll delete it and move to another subreddit . Thanks for letting me know though !
I'm not sure , but I think it's the same one that had the Jets and Giants flairs .
I think you're onto something .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I've never heard this before and it's hilarious !
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing .
I'd watch that .
I'm in the same boat , but I have a job and a family to feed so it's not that bad .
Yes , I did . I used photoshop and a tablet .
I'm sure he'll be back with a vengeance soon enough .
I'm sure he's got a pair of those in his closet somewhere ...
I loved wall e . I was so sad when it ended .
I was thinking that too !
I'm aware but I was just saying that it's not unheard of for ants to help others in need .
I'll PM you my PayPal info , thanks !
Happy birthday !
He doesn't want to win . He just wants to be a part of something special and that's all .
I think that's what happened . They just didn't have enough time to do it .
I think it's pretty cool , but I'm not sure if it'd work well in a movie .
I'm not saying they're stronger , I'm just saying that it's a lot easier to make them .
Thanks for pointing that out ! I was confused by the title and thought it was referring to the country .
He's the best spider man ever .
I think you can use the recall to cancel it .
I'm sure they'll find something else to do for that one .
He's the best looking man in the world .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic .
I'm not sure what this means , but I agree with the sentiment .
I'm pretty sure that's a quote from the movie .
I'm feeling pretty good about it , but I don't know if that's a good thing or not ...
I'm a big fan of the new album by the same name .
You're not alone , brother !
I've been doing this for years , but I'm not sure if it's working ...
I was thinking the same thing , but I think it's more like a combination of the two .
Dormammu , I've come to bargain .
He's a good coach , just not a great head coach .
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I don't stand over the edge of a table , but I do sit on the edge of a bench .
I don't know . I just thought that was a cool idea .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it's pretty clear he understands what he's saying .
You're a good man .
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry at this ...
That's awesome ! I'm glad you enjoyed it , I was really hoping for that kind of response from the audience .
It's not like they're going to be throwing them at the ground , either ...
I'm glad you enjoyed it !
I'm not judging , I just want to know .
Number of years they've been in the conference .
I'm sorry , but I don't understand what you're trying to say here ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think that was a joke .
I'm a big fan of cream cheese , but it's definitely not the same thing .
They did , but it was a screen pass .
I think it's more of a love triangle than a love story .
I think it was a clear penalty , but I don't know if the refs saw that .
A weak one .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but that movie was a masterpiece in my opinion .
I think you mean the dark side of the moon .
I've been to both , and I prefer Skylon's .
I'm from Toronto and I've never seen snow like that before .
I'm sure you can find a better one .
And then I take a loan from him and he takes another debt from me .
I'm crying right now .
I was thinking that too , but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to wear a wig or not ...
I am the one who knocks .
Or both !
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this comment ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ...
I think that was the first time he ever did it .
I would also like to know about this art show , please !
I'm pretty sure he is in the movie .
He told him that he's going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it .
I'm in the UK and I've never heard of this , is it something that's only for certain types of people ?
I think it's more about the fact that they're not going to be able to feed their families .
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I'll take it as a compliment !
I'm not your doctor , but I'll take that as a compliment !
I'm sure you can . Just don't be a bad person and you'll get it done !
He's dead , but not in the movie .
I'm glad he's doing well !
I think you mean 5.75 million .
He's not even that bad of a person . He's just a politician who has no real power or influence over the people .
I think it was a joke , but I'm not sure .
I'll be sure to let you know when I'm ready for you .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this comment ...
I'm not sure if you're serious , but he's dead now .
I think it's just because they're so rare and expensive , but I'm not sure if you could get one without being a cop or something like that ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that I can't play in this game .
And Super Metroid .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think he's actually a pretty good director .
Because he's a clone of Spider Man .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that they didn't do that .
You're right , I'm wrong .
The one that's not the Jets .
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or bad thing .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think it's a good thing to celebrate .
I'm pretty sure that was his plan .
I'm not sure what you mean by that .
I'm not a bot !
done , upvote me back pls
She's probably a fan of the show .
We're not even close to being that bad .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I've never heard of this happening .
He's the best player in the league , but he's not the best player on the team .
I m sorry for your loss .
I think he's just trying to get the camera out of there .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that I got this far .
You're gonna need a lot of help from the refs to do that , but you'll get there !
I'd take that in a heartbeat .
I think you mean Ricardo Quaresma is just as good as Cristiano Ronaldo .
You could use them to cut your nails .
I agree with you on that one . It is a small ranch and it doesn t seem like a ranch at all .
I thought it was a rainbow trout .
I'm not saying you should , but it's a lot easier to watch movies in theaters than on TV .
No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ,
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I'm going to go with'The ' .
I don't have a Twitter . I'm not even sure what that means , but okay .
I'm with you on that one . I've never heard of them before but they're just awful .
I'm going to be honest with you , I laughed at this way too hard .
I'm not sure if I should be worried or excited .
I don't know about that , but I've heard of some guys getting deported for being drug dealers and stuff like that .
Because they're not a threat to anyone .
They should have a joint event with the US and Korea , like the Olympics .
I'm sure it's a lot harder to breathe through your nose than through your mouth , but you can't really tell from the picture .
I have a basement and I'm wondering if it's worth installing a ceiling camera .
I'm glad to hear it !
It's not a matter of rarity . It's a matter of power .
I'm sure they have some sort of security system in place for that .
I'm sure they'll be fine , but I'd like to see a source on that .
Or just shoot them in the head and let nature take its course .
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I agree with your sentiment .
I'm not sure what you mean by that ?
I've never heard of it before but I'm sure it's true .
He's still the head coach of the Browns , so he'll be fine .
I think you mean drowned .
Mine too !
I think you mean a dystopian novel where the world spirals out of control because of its own advancements .
I'm sorry to hear that , but it's okay ! You can cry on your own time if you want .
A place where people are paid to be a part of it .
It's a repost , so it doesn't count as a report .
I'm sure he has a lot of money to spend on food and drinks .
I'm sorry , I didn't know there was a price list . I'll edit it now ! Thanks !
I think you guys are going to get swept by the Warriors in the first round .
I'm sure he's already loaded up on guns , just not in the way you'd like .
I'm not sure if it's because they're all so stupid or because they're all so stupidly stupid ...
He's a good guy .
I think you mean irony .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I've had that exact same reaction to a lot of things .
You're a good man .
I'm sure you're right , I just don't think that's what the OP was asking for .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think that's the joke ...
I'm not saying you will . But if you're going to be a human being , you should have some standards .
The first one is still my favorite of the series , but I'm not sure if it's a reboot or just a continuation .
I'm okay with this timeline .
I think they're cute !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but that's the record for most rushing yards in a single game by a team .
I'm sorry to hear that , but I hope you can find someone who will take care of you !
He's already been there .
They're not even trying to hide it .
I'm sure they would have been fine with a few extra dollars in their pocket , but I doubt it was an economic issue .
Like who ?
He knew it was a 3 point game , but didn't want to risk getting his team blown out by the refs .
I'm pretty sure that's already been confirmed .
I'm not sure if this is a joke or not , but I think it's funny .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think that would be a great idea for a new map .
I'm sure he'll be back in some form or another , but I don't know if he will be as good as before .
I'm going to the same one next week ! I'll be there with you guys and some friends .
You're a hero !
I'm not saying it was her fault but I think that's a bit of an overreaction .
I'm sure it will be a great movie , but I don't think it'll be as good as the original .
You're right , I'm a better driver than that guy !
I think it's a great movie , but I don't think it's his best .
You can't cancel the pie . You just don't get it .
I thought it was a joke until I read the comments .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is happening .
Because they're not good enough .
They're not playing in OT .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is happening , but it's definitely a good thing for the scene .
I think it was a woman .
He's only 26 , so I'd say about 3 more years .
Ramos was already on the ground .
The Packers are my second favorite team .
I'm sorry , but you're not eligible for this challenge .
He's not pouting , he's just being a man and saying it's his fault that they lost .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think that's actually a pretty good analogy .
I'm not sure what you mean by that ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I laughed pretty hard at this one .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not but I think it's more like 1.00 kWh .
It's a fake .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad .
I'm sure he was just trying to help .
I think it's a rule that if you do , you get banned .
I'm not saying it does , but I think that's what he was trying to say .
I think it was a joke .
I'm pretty sure that was the first time I ever saw him pitch .
Porque no se puede ser .
It's a shame because it was such an amazing show and the ending was so perfect .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but it's because of the new IP and the fact that it was released in the summer .
I'm with you on this one ! I can't stand it when I have to wake up at 6am and go to work at 7:30 am .
You can add a lot of things to your name .
I'm a big fan of their stuff ! I've got some more on my instagram : www.instagram.com joshmatthew
I'm gonna delete it , I don't want to be banned from the sub .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I'll take your word for it .
I'm not sure if this is a joke or not but it's funny because the dog food was actually made by a company called Chewie .
I think that's what they were going to do , but the owl was too busy being a pet .
You're not alone !
I'm not sure if it's a joke or not but I've seen this exact comment in every single thread about this gif .
I'd buy it .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think that's the point of this sub ...
I'd play it .
I loved that part too !
Go ahead .
I'm sure you could find a way to get around that , but I don't think the government would like that .
I'm pretty sure that was a joke .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think that's a reference to the movie The Lizards .
I was thinking the same thing , but I think it's just a regular hose .
I think you mean there was no .
I'm pretty sure that's not true , but I don't know enough about him to dispute it .
I think she's fine , but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to nerf her .
He's a troll .
You're a good son , Dad !
He's a guard . He's not athletic enough for the NFL .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but that's a pretty good stat line .
I'm Australian and I've never heard of this . What is it ?
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think that's a joke about how bears are so big and strong they can take down a man .
I'm from Destin too ! I've never seen it this bad before .
I do , but only because I'm a Cavs fan and have to yell Lebron at everything .
I've never had a Kangaroo , but I'm sure it would be delicious !
I think there's a couple of them from the same generation as well .
I have a few of those but not the others sorry !
I think it's a broken wrist , but I'm not sure .
I think it's more like a giant needle .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've never seen anyone use a machete in the UK .
You should be able to retire at the end of this year !
I'm sure you could find a sub for that .
I'm sure they'll be fine if it gets more than one million views .
It's a quote from the movie , not a real quote .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I've never heard of anyone getting arrested for having a handshake deal with someone who's not their client .
I'm sure you can find one for less than 100 bucks on eBay .
I think the generators are more likely to be used for power generation than anything else .
I'm sure you can find some ancient texts online that will help you understand the story better than I could .
I'm not sure if I should be excited or sad that it exists ...
I'm not sure what you're talking about ...
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry ...
I think he could pull off a good Spidey .
He's a good player , but he needs to be more consistent . He's not been that great this season .
I think it's more of a feeling that you're not happy , but you're sad because you're unhappy .
It's a hoodie , I think .
I'm sure he'd be fine with it .
The only one I can think of is the one that says , I'm not your friend , buddy !
He's also a great actor and I think he could pull off a good Joker .
I'm pretty sure that's what happened to CLG .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not . But I think it's more like 50 fat and 30 muscle .
You don't . It's just a prank bro !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not .
I'm not your boy , buddy .
I'm not telling you anything . You're doing it yourself .
To get people to watch the game .
I remember when he got elected to congress , but then he lost his seat because he didn't have enough votes for reelection .
Lonzo is a good kid , but I think his dad was more concerned with his own well being than anything else .
I think it's because he was on the bench .
Sorry , I didn't see that . Will do !
I'm sure they're just going to be fine , but it's still a bit of an overreaction .
I was 12 and I'm now 25 .
I'm so excited for this movie ! I can't wait .
It wasn't , but it was funny to see him try and pull it off .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that I got this .
I was born on 9 11 2001 and I'm still not a citizen .
He's been playing great lately too !
It's a common mistake , but it's actually spelled correctly in the article .
I think it's more likely that he thought he'd be able to get away with it because of the implication .
He's going to run for president .
I am not tall , but I have a pretty good jawline .
You're a good man , Brent .
I'm not a guy , so I don't know if this is true . But I've heard of people having the same effect with marijuana .
I'm pretty sure that's what happened .
I loved lich king , but i think that's because i played it for a long time before WoW came out .
He's a real trooper .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not but I think that's the joke .
I'm at 7 . I think it's a good thing .
I was just trying to be funny and not get downvoted into oblivion . I'm sorry if it came across as rude or anything .
Buy a house .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing ...
I think it's a good idea , but I don't know how to make it happen .
I think TL is the best team in NA right now . They are just so good at everything and have a lot of potential to be really good .
He was the only guy who could get a takedown and win , so I think it's fair to say he deserved a rematch .
I'd rather not have to return my bottle , but I'm sure that's what they're thinking .
I'm pretty sure it's a reference to the movie The Raid .
I'm glad it's not just me !
I'm not sure what that means , but I'll take it as a compliment !
INFP here too !
I'm sure he's a great guy . I hope he gets to be president someday !
I'm hoping for the same thing !
I'm pretty sure they did it in the winter too .
He's in the next one , but it's not a sequel .
I'm a customer too !
I think it's the hair .
It's not like he was banned for anything ...
I don't . I'm British and I've never heard of her .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this comment ...
I'm not sure if they're on Netflix but I've seen a few of them and they're all pretty good .
I'm sure he already has one , but I think it's just for the sake of his own ego .
I'd say frost , but you can't go wrong with either of them .
He's a beast at safety , but he's not a good one .
I think you mean sepak takraw .
I think that's a cat .
I think it was a joke .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that I got this reference ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but it's pretty bad .
I think it's more that they wanted to have a female lead in the next film and she was too old .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ...
I agree completely .
I think you mean Ray Lewis style , but I'm not sure .
I'm pretty sure they're still allowed , but you can't gamble with them .
I think they're just really good at bird law .
I've had that happen before . I'd rather not think about it now though ...
I'm sure you'll be fine , but it's a good reminder to keep your fingers crossed !
I'm not sure about that , but I know he's been playing with the second unit in practice and stuff so maybe it's something like that
I'm not sure if it's illegal or not ...
I think he's going to be a great addition , I'm excited for him !
It's a win win situation for me !
You're not my supervisor !
I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing ...
I think it's because of his hair , but I could be wrong .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've heard that it's actually better to take a vitamin with milk than with kool aid .
I'm pretty sure that's a different school entirely .
I think it's a reference to the fact that they're both in the same game .
I'm sure he's not going to do that . He doesn't want to be seen as a bully .
I'm sure it's going to be cheaper than the original price of the tooth .
I think it's a wig , but I could be wrong .
I'm not a celebrity , I just have a lot of friends who are .
Because they're made for men .
I'm okay with this .
I think you mean mid life crisis .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not . But the review is from a guy who's been using it for years .
You're right , I'm not sure what I was thinking when I wrote that .
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry at this comment ...
I think she was trying to be a bit more relaxed , but I don't know how that would work out for her .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think that's the joke ...
Same here , I was like , oh no !
I have a foot pedal for that too !
I'm pretty sure that's a woman .
He was a great actor and I think he did a good job as the guy who got shot by the cops .
We can't have a double . We need to go deeper !
I'm not sure if I should be proud or sad that we're the only ones who can do this .
I think it's the same guy .
I'm not sure , but I think it's safe to assume that he was high .
I think the late 90 ' s and early 2000 ' s were worse .
I've seen a few , but I'm not sure if they're legit .
I'm sure that's what happened in the US , but I don't think it was a majority vote .
He's a good guy , but he's also a bad guy .
I'm a marine biologist and I can confirm this .
I'm pretty sure that's a lie and you're just trying to make me feel better about my life choices .
I think he'll be fine . He's a good guy and I'm sure he'd do well in the locker room .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think it's a good thing that she is thicccc
I think it was more so that they were a way for the Romans to keep their people under control .
I think that's the point of the movie . It's supposed to be a dark comedy .
Because it's a joke .
I think you mean blind guy with a kitchen counter , but I'm not sure .
The world needs more mecha anime .
I'm sure it's a good thing you don't live in Florida , then !
I'm going to be there in about an hour , so I'll probably be able to get some sleep before the game starts !
You don't , but you can use a vacuum cleaner to remove the cheese from the dogs stomach .
I'm sorry for your loss .
I'm a scientist and I approve this message .
I'm sure they'll be fine , but I don't think it's a good idea to spend money on something you can't afford to lose .
Happy Birthday !
I'm not sure if that sub is a joke or not .
She's a millionaire now , but she was a poor college student in the 80s and 90s .
It's a good thing I'm not driving in that area then !
I'm curious too !
I'm sure he's a good guy but that's the last thing you want to hear from someone who has been through so much .
I did that , but it still doesn't work .
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I don't think it's true for all of them .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think it's a reference from the movie Antz .
Yeah , I've heard good things about Mutemath as well !
I think it's a good price , but I'm not sure if that's what he wanted to get paid .
I'm going to need some more information about your username , please .
I don't think so . I've had mine for a few years and they're still pretty good .
I'm not sure what you mean by treason but I'll take your word for it .
PM sent !
Hawaii is the best !
I think you mean the matrix .
I think he was trying to get him to fall down .
I'm sure you'd have a lot more fun with him as your teammate , though .
He's not the one who made it though ...
I think it means that he's not going anywhere .
It's not , but it looks like one to me .
I would love to opt into the beta !
I'm at about 60 hours and haven't played the game yet , but I've been playing since launch day .
You should probably get that checked out , man !
I'm sure he'll be back in 20 years or so .
I'm not sure if it's the same in the UK , but I've heard of kids learning to read and write at a young age using digital clocks .
I think it's more the fact that they're not good at dancing .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad thing ...
I think it's just the texture of the meat .
Done.back to me , thx
I'm still waiting for a new one to come out , but I think this is the best one so far !
I think it's more like they all had a good idea of who was who and knew how to use them .
You're a towel !
Because it's not a truck . It's a car .
I've heard of it , but I haven't gotten around to reading it yet ! Thanks for reminding me about it !
I'm sure he has a lot more than one truck .
We are all witnesses to the greatest moment in our lives !
RemindMe ! 6 Months Prototype Update
You're not in the top 10 of NZ , but you're still in the top 5 of the world !
I think it was a seal attack on a whale .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not .
I'm not sure if I should be offended or not ...
The spinning back kick .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I upvoted your comment because of the username .
I'm sure there's a lot of people who don't want to buy an electric car because it looks weird or something .
I'm not sure if this is true but I've heard that the best way to learn is by doing .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that we're going to have a game like this .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think that's a pretty good comparison .
I'm sure they care more than you think , but I don't think it's the same as caring about something that happened in the past .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I laughed .
I'm sure they'll be remembered for the same reason we are .
Technically correct the best kind of correct !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not but I agree with your sentiment .
He was a good guy .
I'll have a go at it .
I'm a fan of his too . He's just so ... different from the rest of us .
I'm pretty sure that's not a sedan , it's a BMW M3 .
I've never had Annie's Mac amp Cheese but I'll have to give it a try ! Thanks for the suggestion !
They don't stop coming
I'm aware of that but I think it would be cool to see them adapt the game into something new and different .
I think it's pretty cool . It's not like they're singing it for the entire country or anything , but it's still something to be proud of .
I think he means the ones that have been around for decades , not just street art .
I'm sure they're just as happy to have a new baby than they were to have a dead one .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , but this is exactly what happened .
I think it was a lot of Germans .
I'm sure you'll find it in your inbox .
It's not , but it's still a good movie .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not but I think caffeine can be used as a stimulant in some cases .
I'm a bot , and this action was performed automatically . Please contact u Frozen Aurora if you have any questions or concerns .
I think you're right , but I don't know enough about the internet to say for certain .
I think he means a camp for kids who are too young to go to school and want to be in jail .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it's pretty clear that this was a joke ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is happening , but I am .
I think it's closer than you think .
I'm not a fan of that movie but it's still one of my favorites .
I think it's a combination of the two .
I'm not sure if I want to know what happened in this movie , but I think it's safe to assume that they were all dead by then ...
And the south of Africa .
Thanks a lot , I'll be waiting .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not but I think it's pretty obvious that this was sarcasm .
I'm sure you could have done it with a few minutes of effort , but I don't think that's what OP is asking for .
I've never heard of that , but it sounds delicious !
LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers
I'm sure it's been done before , but I don't think it was ever used in the same way as this .
I think it's safe to say that he didn't make a lot of money from it .
I'm sorry for your loss , but you're not alone in this .
The IRA threat was a hoax . The terrorists were just trying to get rid of the British government and their people .
You mean the British spelling of bin men ?
That's a good point !
I'm not sure if you're serious , but that's exactly what happened with the last one .
I think you mean good boy , but I'm not sure .
I'm sure he was thinking of the people who were forced to work for him .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say here ...
You're a good parent .
I think you're right . I'm not sure how much labor costs would be in that case though .
I'm sure it's a lot more than just the power washing estimate , but I'll take what I can get !
I'm sure they'll be fine with me voting for them again , but I don't think it's a good idea to vote for them in the first place .
And then burn it down !
I think it's more about how they're not getting calls .
It's a good thing you don't have to , because it would be pretty much impossible for that to happen .
He's like a big ol'puma !
The Browns .
I think he's going to get a little bit of a breather and come back in the 4th quarter .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it's a pretty accurate description of what happened to me and my friends when we were kids ...
I think he's a great actor , but I don't know if he's ever been in anything that was good .
I'm not sure what that means , but it sounds delicious !
I've done this before . It's a great way to get your mind off things .
Because they're the best team in the world .
I think you mean : what if there were no ghosts ?
I'd say he's up there with Klay and Draymond , but I'm biased because of my love for the guy .
You are not safe .
I'm not sure what that has to do with anything , but I'll take your word for it .
I'm 16 and have been doing it since I was 15 . It's not a bad thing to do if you're comfortable with your age .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not but that's a great movie !
I'm sure you're a great person and all but I don't think you understand what the word'treason'means .
He's probably still in denial about it , but he has a lot of money now so I'm sure he can afford to pay for it .
I'm not a fan either , but it's the truth .
I think that's what happened to the first one too , but I'm not sure .
She's a keeper !
I'm hoping for a young Martin Lawrence as well !
I don't think that's what they were going for ...
I think the statistic was that there are only 6 unsolved murders in Norway .
It's a good way to get the audience to feel for the characters , though .
I think he's going to be a good guy , but not a good enough one that we can trust him .
I've tried that but it doesn't work for me . I have to use the console command : setav mount 0
I'm the same way with Facebook .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but it's a good thing that the video is so short and to the point .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think that was a joke .
I'm not even sure what that means .
They're not .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but he was a very good player and had a great career .
I'm sure there are plenty of people who don't want to be banned .
I'm not sure if I want to know what that is .
I think it's the one where they go to a bar and get some drinks , but that's just my memory of the first few episodes .
That's what I'm hoping for .
I think you mean the Bale Karius Law of Career Conservation .
I think you're right !
Firefox is a great browser , but it's not as good as Chrome or IE .
I'm sure you're not serious but I think it's funny that you are so upset about something that doesn't even make sense .
I'm not wasting any water . I just don't want to waste it .
I'm 20 and will die before I reach my 50s !
I've never been to a fast casual restaurant and I've lived in both places . Applebee's is definitely not a fast casual chain .
I'm sure she's a real pleasure to be around , but I don't think she'd be so nice if she were actually being serious with me .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I've seen plenty of people who have said Kobe .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it's a pretty fair match .
I'm glad I have a waifu now !
I'm sure they do , but it's not like we're going to be in any real danger of war with them anytime soon anyway .
He's a good player and he was recruited by the school .
He's not going to be elected , but I'm sure he'll get a lot of support from his base .
I'm sorry you're going through this .
I'm pretty sure it's more like being a mutant .
You've never met a racist , have you ?
I'm sure that's what she was thinking .
I'm a huge fan of the band and I've never heard this song before but it's so good !
I would be so happy . I want to see KT vs SKT in a final , but I don't think they'll make it that far .
I'm not saying I don't support my local team , but I'm also not supporting the team that's playing against me .
I was so happy when I saw it happen .
I'm sure you're a great person , but I don't think that's what he meant by this .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ... but it's pronounced'beholden ' .
I think you mean best .
I'm not sure if this is a reference to something , but I love it !
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that I got this reference .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not but I think that's a bit of an exaggeration .
I'm sorry , but it's not a kids movie mom and dad !
It's not a remake , it's a port of the original game .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I've been playing for a while and I've never seen this happen to me .
I'm glad you're not the only one !
I'm sure it's a good idea , but I don't think that would be the case here .
The Bengals and losing to the Browns ?
I'm pretty sure she's dead , but I could be wrong .
I'm not sure what I did wrong , but thanks for the help anyway !
No , it means the US is controlled by the Saudis .
I've caught 2 dragon types in the last few days . I'm pretty sure it's possible , but you have to be very lucky .
I did . I'm not sure why , but it's definitely a kid .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic .
Yes . If they miss it , they need to make up for it with another TD or two .
That's a good one too !
I was thinking the same thing . I think that's what they were going for , but I don't know if it worked or not ...
It's a great movie but the ending is so disappointing .
I think it's more of a reference to the fact that he was in the military .
I think you mean 100th thieves
I think you're onto something .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think that's just because of the way he acts and how he talks about religion .
I've never bent a bar before , but I can't imagine it's that hard .
I think it's more like a taser evolved into a taser .
I'd say that's a pretty safe bet .
I'm in the same boat , but I have no idea how much money I'd need to spend for that .
I'm not sure if I've ever seen a Japanese team so dominant in the last few years , but this is definitely one of them .
He's shooting like 50 from 3 this year , and he was shooting better than Steph last season .
I think so . She's a beast and has been for awhile now .
I think that's what he meant .
I think the only reason it's not as bad is because of the lack of a decent camera .
I'll be waiting for your reply then .
And a strong desire for money and power .
I think he was just hungry and wanted to eat them , but they were all dead by the time he got there .
I'm not sure . I think they're supposed to be used for fuel or something like that .
I'm sure he'll get there eventually , just like his golf course .
I'm holding onto mine too , but it's a 2013 model and I don't have any money left to buy new stuff .
I'm sure you're not the only one who has had that happen to them .
I think it's just a smile .
It's a good thing he didn't choose to stay then !
Yes , but the extra time is only for penalties .
I thought Shaq was 6 ' 9 .
I'm not sure if I should be offended or not ...
I'm sorry , I didn't know that . I'll delete the other one . Thanks !
I've been playing since launch and have only gotten to level 30 . I feel your pain !
I think he's a ref .
When they are no longer a threat to us .
I'm sure he's used to it by now ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote ...
He's a good guy . He's just not very smart .
I agree with you on this one !
All hail the mighty Thanos !
I'd love to see a new bond with both of them .
I'm going to start a cult like religion and I'll be the leader of it !
I'm pretty sure that's a cat named Snoopy .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ... but I think it's funny that you got downvoted for making me laugh .
I'm a fan of the new flavor of peanut butter !
I'm working on a new job right now , and I have no idea how to get my resume in order for it to be considered for hiring .
I'm not sure if you're being serious , but the song is actually pretty good .
RemindMe ! 20 Years
I think it's more that he didn't know how to use his drone .
I would love to have one of these as well . I'm not sure who is the best person for it though .
He was already penalized for the same thing .
It's what plants crave after all .
It's not a case of watertight , but it's definitely not a case of a criminal trial .
I'm sure he's doing just fine now , thanks for the info !
I think the only thing they advertise is their products , but they're not really known for being very good at advertising .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote you for this comment ...
It's a type of cheese .
I've been playing since launch , but I still have a lot of hours to go before I can get into WoW .
I'm watching it on my phone . I don't have a cable subscription , so I can't watch the game .
I'd rather not , but I'm sure it's possible to do with a mod or something .
I'm sure it was a lot more than just Purdue .
I'm pretty sure it's a thing now , but I've never seen anyone wear them .
I'm pretty sure that's what the guy on the left is thinking too ...
It's not anger , it's just a lot of people being angry at one another for no reason .
I'm in the same boat , but my dad is a teacher and he's making about 100k year .
I think it's already started .
I have one of those too . I love her .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think this is a joke .
I have a fear of spiders , and I've never seen one in my life .
I think it's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski , where he is a character in a comedy called'The Big Lebowski ' .
I'd do it for free , but only if you pay me in gum and hotdogs .
I'm a bot , and so is my wife !
I'd rather not .
He's a very good friend of mine , I'm sure he's just not in a good mood .
I'm sure they could afford to pay their employees more than that , but I doubt they'd be able to afford to hire more people .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ... but I think he's being sarcastic .
Step 3 : Profit !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not .
He's a wizard !
I'm Canadian and I love Nickelback !
It's not . It's just that the prisoners are all in different prisons , and they're all at different times of day .
I'm pretty sure he is .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I've never seen anyone say that about a player in this subreddit before ...
I clicked it , but I'm not sure what you're talking about ...
It's a river in the Congo .
She's a witch ! Burn the witch !
It's a good thing he didn't walk out , then !
I think Fury Road is my favorite movie of all time .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but that's a lot of money to spend on a drug that is illegal in most countries .
I'm sorry for your loss of neighbors .
He's been playing well though , he just needs to get his shot going again and he'll be fine .
I've never had a problem with that , but I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not ...
It's not a cure , it's a treatment .
He's been working on it for the last few games , but I think he needs to get his head in the game more often .
You're not alone , I'm seeing it too !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I love the way he looks at me when I wear socks and shoes .
I'm happy and miserable at the same time !
I'm sure he's still alive , just in a different body .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I've always wanted to go there and it sounds amazing !
The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim
You're both dads ?
It's a cat .
I'm not a believer !
A car . I have a few cars and they're all pretty awesome .
I'm not getting it twisted either ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think that's what he meant by we are all part of the universe .
They were probably on a mission to get the best possible outcome for their team .
He's not , he's just doing the same thing as the other guy .
That's true , I guess that's why I'm so surprised by how many people have no idea about this .
I think they're still better than SKT tbh , but I'm not sure about that .
You're a good man .
I'm going to use this one , thanks !
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this comment ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or not . But I think the Korg is a bit more expensive than the Mieke .

I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think that's the joke ...
I'll take it , but I'm not sure if he's going to be able to do that with a new team .
Good to hear man . Hope you get some rest soon .
You're not from Cleveland , you're just ignorant and don't know what's good for you .
It's like a scene from a movie .
I thought it was a little too big for him .
I've been in a few accidents and I'm pretty sure you can't die from being upside down for more than 4 hours .
I'm not sure I understand your comment , but I'll upvote you anyway because it's funny and makes me laugh .
We're up by 20 and we're down by 10 .
I'm not saying he's bad but I don't think he'll be as good as he could be .
I'm not saying it was a good idea , but I don't think he would have been able to do it without the help of his teammates .
I'm sorry , but it's not a light bulb . It's a lamp .
I had a laser sword that could cut through the ground and walls . It was pretty cool .
I'm sorry to hear that , but you're lucky .
You're not the only one !
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this ...
Electroshock is fine .
I think the worst ones are the ones that sound like a word that's not even in French .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think that would be a good idea .
I'm a student at UT and we have a similar system .
I've always called them cow cats , but yours makes more sense .
I've never used vinegar , but I'll give it a shot ! Thanks for the tip !
That would be awesome ! I'd love to see that .
I think she was just trying to get a good look at her .
I'm not sure if I should be offended or not , but this is a pretty good point .
Because the detector detects the detector .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this ...
I'm not sure if it's true but I think he got banned for a reason .
I remember those days , but I don't think they were as bad as this one is .
I think you mean 2018 .
I'm 6 ' 3 and I don't play basketball , but my dad is 6 ' 4 so he's probably taller than me .
I don't . I'm not sure what that means though ...
My dog eats everything I bring in . He's a big boy and he loves it .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad thing ...
I'm pretty sure that's a felony in some states ...
I'm going to watch Split this weekend , I've heard good things about it !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it's funny that you say this because of your username .
Hulk Hogan was a great actor and I think he would have been perfect for that role .
I got one for Christmas , I think it was like 15 bucks ?
I think you mean the Chevy Spark .
He's a good player .
I'm going to be honest here and say you left it at home .
Hello , future person !
I think you're right about that .
I'm sure the Chinese are going to make some diamonds out of it too ...
Because it was a clear goal scoring opportunity .
I'm not American , but it is still a lot more than the average price here .
PM sent !
They'll just say it was a joke and move on with their lives .
I think they're called'legs ' .
He's not , but he is very good at what he does .
You're a good man , u TheRealDankestOfUses .
I think it was more of a joke than anything else .
I have a masters in economics and I'm not even a real economist !
And the people that bought the rights to Star Wars and Marvel comics go out of business .
He was a spy for the Templars , and he wanted to get rid of them .
I think you mean chest .
It's a very common mistake , but it is still a good way to get your bud into the smoker .
I'm 25 and I've got a smartwatch .
That's what I was thinking , but I don't know if they'd be able to handle the heat .
I think you mean 6 . Spain
He's too busy being a dad to be in the show anymore .
It's not hard , just time consuming .
I'm sure the aliens will be fine , they're not like us .
He's a big guy , but he's not that big .
I'm sure he could play a lot of different positions , but I don't think he'd be able to play the same position for more than 2 minutes at a time .
I'll take it !
He's been great this year but I think it was more of a case of him being outplayed by the other guys on the team than anything else .
I'm sure he's a great guy !
I think they'll use a lot more than 2 , maybe 3 or 4 .
I remember it . It was a good car , but not a great car .
I'm sure it's a joke , but I think he was actually serious .
I think he was just trying to get his wife to calm down and not cry .
They're already there .
I'm rooting for ND but I think they'll pull it out .
I'd watch that movie .
He got it from his dad , not Lebron himself .
You're a blue ?
You're welcome , we all have our moments .
I'm married with two kids .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think the tie was a result of the refs being bad .
You're right , you should just pirate everything and then never have to worry about it again !
I love that ! I have a cat who does this too , but he's not mine . He's a rescue so I'm not sure if it's a breed thing or what ...
I'm not even a Cavs fan , but I still think it's funny .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I laughed pretty hard at this .
I'm sure the US will be fine with that , they're a lot more than happy to have their oil money go elsewhere .
I'm sure there are plenty of jobs that require a lot more than just construction .
I'm pretty sure that's what they call a'mistake'in the US .
I'm not even going to be mad if Brazil wins that one , I'll just be happy for them .
I've never heard that before , but I like it !
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ...
Because it's a good idea .
I think it's a reference to the song , not the video .
I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this is not the best way of getting answers from people who are actually interested in the subject matter .
Hakuhou is the best player in the world .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say but I think you're saying that the game is too easy and that's why people quit ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ... but I like it !
I think it's a good game , but I'm not sure if it'll be as competitive as last year .
I'm a warlock and I approve this message .
I think they'll beat Brazil , but not by much .
I'm sure it will be a big hit for them too .
I think you mean offense .
I agree , but it's not like he has any real power anyway .
Juventus would have to win the tie and then they would play a extra game .
I'm not sure if I've ever seen a team do that before .
Plot twist : he was a janitor for years and never quit , but now he's a janitor for life .
The V10 is a beast .
I remember the first time I saw one . It was like a big door with a little window and a little door .
It's a little bit of a pain , but I'm sure you can figure out how to do it yourself .
I'm glad you liked it ! I love seeing people's faces when they get a new one !
I'm not sure if you're being serious but I think that's actually a good idea .
He is , but it's not like he has to worry about that anymore .
I'm sure they're just trying to get a good view of the sunrise .
I think he was in a coma for a few days after that , but I'm not sure .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think the price of katanas has actually gone down in Japan .
I thought it looked familiar !
I'm not sure what you're talking about . I called a timeout after the first one , but it was a good call .
I'm sure you're right but I think it's time to start demanding some calls that aren't going our way .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think he's actually a Giants fan .
Little bit of both .
I'm glad I could help , I've had the same problem for a while now and it's always so frustrating to have to restart the game every time .
I think it's more about the fact that he was already dead and they were all in his range .
It is , but I don't think it will be able to survive in a tank for long enough to become a frog .
I'm glad you like it ! It's one of my favorite posters from the series .
I think it's just a big ol'puppy .
I'm a girl .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think it's a joke .
I'm sure you'll be fine .
Because it's not a thing .
You're right , but that doesn't mean there aren't many people who have them .
I'm sure they're just as adorable when they're dead .
I think you mean the future .
I'm afraid of what Baku 2020 will bring us ...
I thought it was a dog at first too !
I'm not sure if you're serious but I think that's what they do when they get bored with school work .
He's got to be the youngest player in the league .
You're not missing out on much .
I'm sure the people who did it would be happy to get a few years in prison .
I'm sure they'll be fine with a billion dollar market share .
I'm sure he was just trying to get out of there as fast as possible .
And the great cinematography !
I'm not sure if this is a reference to something or just an observation .
I got a shiny Charizard !
I'm sure they're just trying to make a living , I don't think it's illegal for them to sell drugs .
You can't tell me what to do ! I'm not your father !
I'm sorry , I don't speak Spanish .
I think you mean Intelligent Design .
He's a big boy .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or sad that this is the first time I've ever seen this joke in this sub ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think the original trilogy was only like 30 million .
He's not even the best candidate .
I think it would be cool to see him as an antagonist , but I don't want to see him die .
It's not . It's just for aesthetics .
I think you mean , “ The only mistake they make is to not use a comma . ”
I'm sorry for your loss .
I'm not a gang , I just like to party !
I think she was just trying to get a reaction out of him , but he didn't respond so she had no choice .
You can't . You're not a citizen yet .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I think he's joking .
I think the idea is that it was a dragon , not an animal .
It was at the end of a trail in the woods , so it wasn't really a basket . It was just a big metal thing hanging from the tree branches .
He's also not a lawyer .
I'm not even a dolphins fan and I was just thinking that .
He's a good actor , but I don't think he's that attractive .
Double the fun !
I'm a robot , I can't feel emotions .
I'm watching it right now . It's pretty good , but I don't think it's as good as the book .
It's not that hard , just look at the colors of the letters and you'll see it pretty easily .
I'm a student . I don't have any classes .
I'm not sure what you mean by that but I agree with your point .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but that's a great movie .
I think you mean the universe is 200,000 , 000 light years across .
I'm not a subscriber and I've been banned before .
Bob is the best !
You were number 156023 of Thanos ' 231259 children snapped r inthesoulstone . u KingThorian is your neighbor . Sorry , but you weren t given a snap buddy . u TheMadPieKing is your neighbor .
I'm not your homie , bro !
I'm not sure what you're getting at .
I think she's a great actress . I'm not saying it was bad or anything but I don't think it's a movie that should be made right now .
I'm sure you're a lot better off than most of us .
I'm a dad and I've never had a kid .
He's not going anywhere , he's got a lot more money than you think .
You're not alone , my friend !
It's a movie , not an opera .
I'm not sure if I can do that . I don't have any keycaps to put on it .
I'm not even sleeping . I just woke up from a nap .
I think it's more likely that he was a victim of the shooting .
You're a monster !
I'm sure it was just a little bit of pain .
I'd say it's about a 7.5 10 .
He's not going to win any states that matter .
I think she's going to have a lot of trouble getting out of this one .
The effect .
Because it's not a foreign political bodyguard , it's an American citizen who was attacked by foreign military forces .
I think he was trying to do a front flip , but it didn't work out so well for him ...
I think it was a yacht .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ...
I've seen this one , but I don't remember any of the characters from it . Is there a specific scene that you think makes it stand out ?
I'd watch it .
I think you mean a moose .
He's still on the payroll though ...
I follow him too . I think he's a cool guy .
Zucker is a lizard person confirmed !
I'd be okay with that .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is the first time I've heard of her .
I'm sorry . I hope you feel better soon !
It was the best match of the night .
I think the first one was a little too much , but I'm not sure about the second one .
He's just a little bit of a sore loser .
I think she was just trying to get him out of there .
I'm aware of that but she was born in 2000 so she is still a little young .
Season 2 is pretty good , but season 1 was great too !
I think they'll get the idea and just do it again .
I've played all of those games . I'm not a big fan of them but they're fun to play with friends and family .
I'm sure they will , but I think it's a good idea for the community to get involved and help out with this .
Remember me
I think it's a dog .
I've never heard of him .
I'm sure they would have done it anyway , but I think this is a good example of why it's important to be careful about what you say on the internet .
Will do , thanks !
I think you mean 36 years ago ...
I was thinking the same thing , but I think it's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski .
I'm sure he's a great guy , but I don't think he has the temperament to be president .
I'm going to use it for a bowl of cereal later today !
Nice to meet you hungry , I'm dad joke .
I'm pretty sure that's a cat .
I think you're right , but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to stop talking when someone else is trying to eat your face .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I've spent a lot of time searching for reagents and finding nothing .
I think it's a good movie , but I don't think it deserves to win .
I was going to say , I'm pretty sure that's the same thing as 7 3 .
I'm in .
I'm sure they'll be sold at a discount if you're willing to pay more than 10 bucks for a bag of brownies .
It's a good thing the onion is satire , then !
I'm so sorry for your loss .
I'm sure he is ! I just want to make sure you know that he's a good boy and not a bad boy .
You can't . It's not in the game yet .
I m not saying you re wrong . But that s what happened .
I would love one !
J'ai pas mal , j'aime bien sur le m me chose .
I'll be there with you , brother !
I had to eat cereal on school days because it was too hard to get the milk out of the cereal bowl .
Can you PM me too please ? Thanks !
I'm sure he's not going to be a head coach . He'll probably be an assistant or something .
I've never had that , but I'll look into it ! Thanks for the tip !
I think she's a bit too thin for him , but he'll have to settle for her being a little taller than him .
Sweden wins the group .
Thanks ! I'm really happy with how it turned out .
I think you mean 8 disposing of .
I'm sure he'll have plenty of shoes to go with his feet .
Brazil is a great country and I love living there but it's not like they're the only ones who have been affected by this .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think he is actually an American plant .
Because he is a good guy and has done some good things .
Because they're not Polish , and that's why they're always angry !
I'm going to the one in the mall .
The french revolution was a failure because of the lack of food .
I'm a guy and I do this too , it's weird to me that guys don't do it more often .
I don't know , but I'm not sure if it's going to be as bad as it was before .
I think it's already been done , but I'm not sure if it was a success or not .
You're not alone , I'm with you on that one .
It's a good thing we have modern technology .
I'd watch it just to see him in a wig .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think it's a good idea to keep your computer on for at least 10 minutes before turning it back on .
He was a pretty good cook too .
Thanks for sharing !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think it's funny that you say this because the cornflakes are actually pretty good .
I'm sure they'll just make it out of the country with no problems , right ?
I'm sorry to hear that . I hope you get better soon !
It's not . It's just a big storm .
It's not , it was just a few days ago and I'm pretty sure they were open .
. , .
I'm sure he's a great guy , but I don't know if you can call him a genius .
I'm not sure what you mean by this .
I'm a matinee . I can confirm this is true .
I'm just glad you're here to help !
I'm not attracted to anyone , I just want to be with someone who is .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think it's funny that they are so against the government .
It's not like he was a good guy or anything . He just wanted to be with his family and friends .
They can , but it's not a guarantee .
It's a great show but I wouldn't say it was a must watch . It's definitely worth watching if you're into that kind of thing though !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but that's a pretty good reason to get attacked by a bear .
I think it's more of an inverted double back flip .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but it's true that most Americans are fans of soccer and football .
I'm pretty sure that's not true .
That's a good one too !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ...
I'd imagine it would be pretty hard to get through that sheet of paper , but I'm not sure how much more difficult it is than a normal person's face .
Because the House of Representatives isn't a democracy , and it's not like Trump has any real power over the president .
She's already been cast as a character in the new Star Wars movie , so I wouldn't be surprised if she was in that one too .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but that's actually pretty funny .
And my axe !
I'm going to have to try this out !
Original Chicken
You're not wrong , but I'm not sure if that's the best way to go about it ...
I'm white and I don't have any anxiety or anything like that .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but that's a pretty good stat for a team that was down 30 points in the first quarter .
I have , but it's been a while since I've seen it .
I'm sure they're just going to use a different one next time .
It's not even their final form !
I'm sure you can find a good deal on them online , but they're not cheap !
It's a shame they didn't get the rights to the song , though .
I think that's because it was a terrible movie , but I'm not sure .
I think it's a girl , but I'm not sure .
I think he's talking about the fact that he was a head coach for 3 years .
I think it's just a way to show off your skills and get some feedback from others on how you're doing .

I think you mean'fell ' ...
I think you mean'lot of words ' .
It's a custom UI . I'm not sure if there are any other options .
I have the same problem on Xbox One , but I don't think it's a hardware thing .
He's got the same amount of muscle as he did in college .
I'm going to have the same problem , but with Fallout 4 instead of Spiderman .
I agree with you there .
I'm proud of them too . They're playing well and they're getting better every game .
I think you mean a great culling must occur .
I think it was more that they wanted him to be a part of the show .
It was a pretty big ocean , but I think you're right .
I think you mean'naps ' , not'pax ' .
I think you're thinking of the wrong person , buddy .
It was actually the first time I ever called 911 , so I'm not sure what you're talking about ...
I see a young Michael Cera
I'd be okay with that .
Because they're not playing Dota .
I'm not sure what that means but I'll take it !
Steven Martin is a great name for a serial killer though , and he's not even dead yet !
It's not , it's a woman .

I'm sure they will , but I don't think it's a good idea to do so .

I've never had a chicken that wasn't overcooked .
He's a good guy , but I don't think he was ever really in it for the money . He just wanted to get paid .
I'm not sure what you're talking about . I've never seen a bag of milk in my life , and I don't think it's ever been mentioned on the show .
I'm a bit of an optimist . I think it's a good idea and I don't see why people are so against it .
Thanks ! I'd love that , if you don't mind .
I'd rather have Dr Doom than Galactus .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but he's been a top 5 pick for years now and has had one of the best rookie seasons in NFL history .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is happening .
I think that's what I'm thinking of .
I thought it was Academi ?
Congrats ! I'm sure you'll be fine .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think it's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski .
He's a good guy , but he's not a hero .
They could do a Skyrim game , but I don't think that would be very good .
They had 2 time outs .
You can't use the code on your own account . You need to be logged in with a PSN ID .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I'll take your word for it .
I'm just saying that if you're going to be banned for something like this , at least make sure you don't get caught in the crossfire of comments .
Ryze was nerfed ? I thought he got a buff .
Well , I know a few people who do .
I've had spiders that could get into my house and eat my cat , but not my dog .
I'm going to use them for a lot of things .

It's a new song by the band .
It's the bird that gets stabbed in the back and dies from blood loss .
I'm sure they'll be fine , but I don't think they'd want to risk it .
I think he's going to retire after this season , but I don't know if that means we'll have a new coach next year or not .
They were trying to get a foul called on them , but they got fouled anyway so it doesn't matter anymore .
I think that's the joke , but I'm not sure .
I do . I'm a passenger and it's not like I have to drive anywhere else .
I'm sure it's not that hard . It's just a matter of time before someone makes a video explaining how to do it .
I thought it was pretty good , but I'm not sure if that's what you meant by Best Animated Feature Oscar .

He's a good actor .
There's also a Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores Dolores

I'm sure they're all in on it , but I don't see any evidence that they have any real plans beyond a few days after the election .
I'm sure it'll be a good laugh .
That's what we said about the Prem last year .
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or bad thing , but I think we're going to be in the playoffs for a while now .
I'm not hating on him , I'm saying that's the only reason he was hired .
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I'll take your word on it and try to get ahold of someone who can help . Thanks !
I'm thinking of doing that next time I go to the store !
I've never met him personally but his wife is a friend of mine who works for him . She says he's very nice and has great respect for everyone .
What's your favorite color ?
I think you mean Sam Rockwell , the actor who played him in the first Batman movie ?

I'm not sure if you're being serious or not ...
I'm pretty sure that's a myth , but I could be wrong .
Because it's fun .
It's a video game , and it's not real life .
I'm sure they'll be able to find some way of getting that information out .
Yes please !
I'm here .
I'm pretty sure it's one per person , but I could be wrong .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad for him .
I think it was a joke about how she's not a criminal .
I'm not a simulation ! I'm a computer !
I'm sure they'd be delighted to hear that !
I'm guessing it's a good number .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but that's actually pretty accurate for most people in the US .
I think it's more about how much they enjoy being in the spotlight .
I think you mean the old man the boat , not the old man the ship .
I think so . I'm not sure though , I just know that's who she looks like .
I think you mean the dankest timeline .
I've never heard it called that before but I'll take your word for it ! Thanks !
The only time I can think of is the 2011 Daytona 500 .
I think that's the point ...
I think it's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski .
I think he was just trying to be funny , but I agree it was a bit too much for me .
I'm sorry to hear that .
I'm sure you're a great person but I don't think you understand what we mean when we say public servant .

I'm not sure what you mean by trimmed nails ?
Happy Birthday !

He probably has them on in his car , and he's not going out to get them .
I have a cat and a dog . They're both awesome .

I'm sorry to hear that . I hope you can find someone who loves you and is happy with you .
I'm sure the CIA has been working on this for years now ...

You're a good person .
I'm not sure if that's a quote from him or not , but I love it !
I'm a fan of both teams , but I think the Cavs are going to win this year .

I'm glad you enjoyed it !
It's a beast that eats jellyfish .
I don't , but I'm sure it's a lot more than 1.5 million .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've never had an issue with Facebook installed on my S6 .
I think you're on to something .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad thing ...
Because it's not . It's a real picture of the guy in the photo , and he is wearing a shirt with his name on it .
It's a clock .
He's not a remake , he's a sequel to the original .
I'm pretty sure that's what they're going to say in the next few decades .
He's a troll , ignore him .
I'm sure he'll be able to find a way to make it about the Pope and his family .
I'm sure she's not blaming anyone , but I think it's safe to say that she's not a good driver .

I feel you man . I've been watching the game on mute because of this .
You are a hero .
Sorry , I didn't know there was a daily discussion thread ! Thanks for letting me know !

Bob's is the best .
I'm not sure , but it's probably the only one that isn't on the list .
They did say that the new facility would be in the same location as the old one .

I love my country , it's beautiful and I have a lot of friends there .
I have a brother named Junior and he's a senior .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not ... but I'll fight you anyway .
I think it's more that the African teams have been playing really well and are just getting better .
I thought it was a hat ?
I'm not going to be able to afford a house by the time I'm 50 , so I'll probably just live on my own for a while .
I'm sorry for your loss .
I'm sure they have some kind of device that can do it for them .
I'm sure it was , but I don't think that's what the article is saying .
I'm sure you'll be fine !
I'm in my last year and I've had it happen to me twice .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not but I think that was sarcasm .
I think that's what they were doing .
I'm gonna be so disappointed if it doesn't end in 2026 .
I'd laugh at the fact that they're going to win it .
I think you mean the most pure of tv love stories .
I would . I'd be happy with that .
I'm not sure if this is a joke or not ...
I'm not sure , but I think it was from a job that paid more than minimum wage .
I hope you do , she's so cute and sweet !
It's not just WA . It's everywhere .
I'm pretty sure it's u jayhawkins
I think it's more about the fact that people are willing to work for less than minimum wage .
It's not that hard , just keep your eyes open for a while .
It's not , it's just that the majority of Christians don't believe in Jesus and the Bible .
I'd rather have a PG than a SG , but I'll take what we can get at this point .
I don't know , but I'm sure he's going to be back .
I'm saying that the tax rate is too low .
I'm imagining a giant shark eating your face off .
I think it's because they're all in the same room and there are no sound effects or anything .
I think it's because they're trying to make the reviewer feel better by giving him a free copy of the game .
I think he's already there , but I'm not sure .
I'm sure he'll be fine .
I agree with you but I'm not sure what the point of this comment was ...
I'm not sure what you mean , but I think that's the point .
He's been in a lot of movies , he just hasn't had much screen time since the last one .
I've heard that they are also good at detecting the smell of gasoline .
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but it's a pretty good summary of the post .
I have not . I'm from the UK and don't know what that is .
I think that's what I'm thinking too , but it doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the story .
The Walking Dead .
I'm with you . Zero is a great song , but it's just so ... boring .
I think you mean the lack of a sense of humor .
They are a super team , but they aren't a super team without KD and Steph .
The same one that's been used for the last 50 years .
Thanks ! I'm glad you enjoyed the graphic .
I think it's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski , where the character is named Walter White and he has a fridge in his house .
I've been meaning to try out some of the places on this list !
I've been there . It's amazing .
I'm a neutral , but I want Germany to win it all .
That's what I'm thinking .
But rises again , harder and stronger !
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've been using a mage for the last few weeks and it's still doing well .
I'm gonna let you in on a secret , but I'll tell you what it is : I'm not a rapper .
We're not that great .
They're not a team that's going to be around forever , so it makes sense .
I'm sure you can find a place that does , but it's not like they're going to be able to afford it .
I've seen a lot of people build on the top of mountains , but I don't think that's what OP is talking about .
I think it's because he was so close to being able to do it .
I'm not sure what you're getting at here ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not but I think that's a great idea !
I'm sure that's what happened in the video .
He's been great this season , I'm really happy with his development and how he has developed over the last few years .
I'll be in .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I've been playing WoW for over 10 years and have no plans to stop anytime soon .
I'm sorry to hear that . I hope you get some help soon !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think it's a pretty good movie .
I'm not high enough to know that .
Same here , I was like , oh yeah !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I've never heard of that before ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it's more like people are just lazy and don't want to pay for something they already own .
I'm not even mad .
I think you mean experience . Experience is a big part of being a QB in the NFL .
I'm sure they will be compensated in some way , but I don't think it's going to be a lot of money .
I've had a few of those happen to me too , but they were the same speed as you and they didn't stop .
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I'll take it as a compliment ! Thanks for the feedback !
They built a wall .
I'm not sure what you mean by this but I agree with your sentiment .
Thanks for your support !
Because that would be too easy , and people would think it was a joke .
I'm sure it was a suicide by bullet to the head .
I think you can use a hat or something , but I'm not sure if it's the same as putting them on .
I'm sure he'll be fine with 3 hat tricks in the next few games , but I think he's going to need some rest after that one .
I think you mean TL Piglet .
I'm surprised you're not dead yet !
She's not signed to Raw , but I think it was a stipulation for the match .
! remindme 1 week
You're in .
It's a type of tea .
Remember me
I'm sure you'll find it in the trash .
Yeah , I agree . I think it's a good idea to keep the pattern and just use the same colors as the original tiles .
I'm sure they'll be fine , but I don't think it's a good idea for them to have a president who is so disliked by the country .
I think it's more that they don't care , but I'm not sure .
I think you're right about that . I was just thinking in terms of how it would look if we were all living on a single planet .
I'm not sure what I expected from a comment like this ...
Or you're just a really good player of doom and metal .
I know . I was surprised too .
I think it's the angle of the camera , it looks like he is holding it with his left arm .
It's a good place to be when you're not in the middle of nowhere .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think that would be a good idea .
I think they're going to do a new one with a different cast and crew .
I'm sure you can find a way to do that .
I'm sure you could , but it would be a lot of work .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but Dave Grohl was in the band before it was cool .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think that's the most likely scenario .
Tom Hardy .
I think it's in the second to last paragraph .
I think you're right , I've never seen a recipe like this before !
You can't press it . It's not there yet , but you'll get there eventually !
I like Juno !
I think he was nominated for his role in The Usual Suspects .
I'm not sure what you mean by that ?
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a shower with your phone or not ...
He'll probably be like I'm not even mad , I just want to see a good game .
I'm sure they have a lot of spare time for that .
If it's a tie , no one gets to win .
I'm not sure if I've heard that one before , but it's a great song !
I'm not sure what you're getting at here ...
You're not an adult if you can't afford to pay for your own education .
I'm sorry , but that's not how it works .
Jurassic World : The Last Jurassic World .
I'm not crying , I just have a headache .
It's not that bad . I've been in a lot of accidents and it doesn't happen often , but it happens .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but I laughed pretty hard at this .
You're a good person .
I've been having this problem for a while now . I think it's an issue with the mobile site , not the app itself .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've never had this issue and I use my real name for everything .
I saw .
I've had it done to me a few times and have never seen it done on my own .
I'm Australian , I know what you mean .
I'm not sure what the difference is between a tanktop and a tshirt , but I've never worn one .
He's not the one who made the penalty , he was just trying to get it out of the way .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not but I think it's pretty clear that he didn't .
It was pretty much the same , but with a lot of spices and different ingredients .
I think he's better than Curry .
I thought that too but I think the kick was a little more than just a block .
I think the Cavs are looking for a backup PG , but I could be wrong .
I'm sorry , but I don't speak Japanese .
I'm pretty sure that's what happened .
I'm not saying it was collusion , but I think that's what they were trying to do .
I think the elephant is a troll .
Sony is a big part of Marvel's success , so they probably want to keep their hands off the movie .
They're not playing the Giants .
I'm a big fan of the album , but I've never really listened to it . I'll have to check out some songs from it !
I've never heard that before , but I'll keep it in mind for the future ! Thanks !
I'm not sure , but if you're going to be a troll , at least make it funny .
I'm not sure if that's legal in most states .
That was the first thing I thought when I read this .
I think you're thinking of a different kind of weird ...
I'm sure they're all laughing at you now .
I know but still ...
I'm sure he'll be fine , but if you're going to do that , at least make it a bit more obvious .
Thanks , I'm interested in seeing how it goes .
I'm sure the US will be happy to take him back if we don't get anything good for him .
And the only thing he knows about football is that it's not a game of football , but a game of life !
Because the Russian government doesn't want her .
I'm a kid and I've never seen that show .
I think you mean a condiment .
I think they should rename it to EU Mid Caps Jokes
I think that's a good point , I'm not sure why people are so against it though .
I've been meaning to get that one too !
I'm not even a spurs fan and I feel this pain .
He's not dead , he just got better .
I don't think so , he was just really angry .
I'm sure they'll be fine , but it's not like they're going to have a lot of time for that .
I don't think so . I've had my windows scratched with a hammer before and they're fine .
I'm not sure what you're getting at , but I think it's pretty obvious that you're being sarcastic .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think it's the other way around .
It's not ?
I'm not sure what's worse , being in a middle east prison or having your own country .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I've heard this before and I think it's true for a lot of people .
I was thinking the same thing ! I love that book so much , and this is one of my favorite covers ever .
I think it's a good thing that they're not all in the same country , then !
I'm sure they have a camera on their phones , but I don't know if it's legal for them to record that .
I'm sure you're a great guy and all , but that's not really the point of this thread ...
He was a KGB agent .
I'm a tattoo artist . I approve of your approval .
I'm not seeing it ...
Nor this .
I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing ...
I think he's one of those guys that you just know is going to be great and will have an amazing career .
I think it's on medium , but I'm not sure .
Spotify is a great service but I don't think they have ads .
I'm sure he's got some sort of security clearance .
He's not even 30 yet .
I'd watch that movie .
Bad defense .
Nani is the name of a character in the anime .
I have a rottie that does this too !
He's not playing .
The CIA ?
You're a good man .
He's not a citizen .
I'm in the same boat as you . I have a few of his films on DVD but no streaming service for them .
Because he's a fan .
SKT T1
He's just trying to get his shot back .
I was thinking the same thing , but I think it's a pretty cool car .
I was thinking more like a young Sarah Palin .
You're not supposed to drink it all in one sitting , you have to take breaks and then go back to work .
I'm a Warriors fan and I think you guys are gonna be good this year .
I'm not sure what you mean by that .
I'm pretty sure that was a joke , but I don't know enough about Kirby to tell if it was or not .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think that's a pretty good estimate for the number of people who will be watching this show .
I'm sure you're a great person , but I don't think that's what happened here ...
I think it's more that the movie was terrible .
I'm from Wisconsin and I've seen them all over the country .
I'm not crying , you're crying !
I think so . I'm not sure though .
I'd watch that .
I'm pretty sure that's a reference to the movie .
I love Talk Talk , but I'm not sure if it fits what OP is looking for .
I don t know , but I m sure they do .
He's a pretty big guy , I think he'd be more likely to be on the side of the temple than the main one .
He's a politician . He knows what he is saying and how to use it .
It's not like they're going to do a moon knight and night wing crossover , but I agree with you on this one .
I'll give you 50mil for him and a bag of chips .
Secret Wars was pretty good .
If you're looking at a phone with a removable battery and SD card slot , then go for it .
I love the name !
I think she's going to win the next one .
I think that was a joke .
I'm sure you're not the only one who's seen that statistic .
I'm sure you could find a job that pays more than 70B in the US .
You're the best ! Thanks for your help , I really appreciate it .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think it's a joke .
I'm in the same boat as you .
I think it's more of a combination of both .
I think he's going to go for it on 4th down and try to get a field goal .
He's like a young , fat , balding , bearded version of the guy from The Office .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but that's exactly what my wife does .
I think they're trying to make up for it by giving us a bye week .
Buy a boat .
I'm sorry to hear that . I hope you can find another one !
I'm not a Jedi yet !
I'm not sure if you're serious or not . But he's actually been pretty decent for us this year .
I've been there ! It's great !
I'm going with both , but I think he's gonna die horribly .
Happy Birthday !
I'm doing it right now , but I have no idea what's going on .
It is , but not as much as you'd think .
It's not about the quality , it's about the message .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but they were ranked in the AP poll .
The owner is a private company , so I'm not sure if they own it or not .
It's a very happy face !
I'm down for a game !
I'm sure it's a lot of fun , but I'd rather have a nice , clean , well kept car than one that looks like a trash can .
I think so !
Yeah , but you can just use them to get around .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but that's actually a really good movie .
He's probably not even that fat .
I've seen them in Finland as well !
I'm not sure what you mean by sparsely populated ?
I'm glad you enjoyed it !
I think it's more that he didn't have a car .
It was a good call , but I think it should have been a penalty on the play before .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not but I think that's a myth .
I think he's already a big movie star , but I agree with you on this one .
I'm a dude , but thanks for the compliment !
I would , but I'm not sure if the freezer is big enough .
He didn't say anything about America though ...
I'm sorry to hear that , but at least you got a free game !
I've only pulled 1k . I'm a little worried about the next few weeks though ...
They were going to the bathroom .
I got a full time position with a company that pays me about 60k .
You're a good person , and you should feel good about yourself for saying this .
I've never had this problem before .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but it's a good idea to pretend to be Muslim and then go back to being homeless .
I'm going to go with this one .
I was expecting a movie about the 9 11 hijackers , but this is better .
I think it's a dream .
He's not fit enough to play in the CL .
I'm not sure if I should be excited or scared that this is happening ...
I think they should do a prequel to episode 3 , and then a sequel to episode 4 .
It's the same thing as a play where you have to pass the ball around the box and then shoot .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing ...
And then the ice cream is melted and eaten by the other team .
I think you mean foxes are basically tiny cats that combine with a dog .
Or the elderly .
I'm sorry for your loss .
Fool me once ...
That's what happens when you have no idea how to use your brain properly .
It's a joke . It's not real .
I'm not seeing it , what's going on ?
I think he was on the team with Conor .
I'm sure they would be able to do that with a little help from the government .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I think it's funny .

I'm still here , just not at work .
I think you mean fungi .
I know , but I'm saying that it's not like he's doing it for free or anything . He's just doing it because he likes it .
It's a karate move , but it's not a karate move .
I think he's more of a Captain Planet .
I'm not sure , but I think they have to be registered with your name and address .
I feel like that was more of an accident than anything else .
I'm paying about the same as you , but I don't have to live with my parents anymore because they're all dead .
I'm not sure what you mean by that but if you're talking about your insurance company then yes they do charge the same .
I'm not getting my hopes up . I just want to know what happened .
I'm sorry to hear that .
I'm sure they do , but it doesn't mean that they're going to be able to lead us through this .
I think so . I'm not sure though .
I've never been to one of those but I'm sure they're great !
I'm not sure what that is , but I'll look into it . Thanks !
I'm not sure if you're serious , but he's a great actor and I think he deserves more recognition for his work than he gets .
I'm not sure if I should be offended or not that you think this is a good idea ...
You don't . You just have to be willing to work for free and not be lazy .
He has a lot of powers but I think his most important one is his healing factor .
I think Toy Story 4 would be better than Toy Story 3 .
I think it's a great episode , but I'm not sure if that was the best produced episode of any show ever .
I'm not a tourist . I just like to go there for the scenery and the food .

I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad for you ...
I was expecting the same thing , but I think he's too busy being a good boy and not getting hit by cars .
I'm not sure what you mean by this .
It was a joke , but I guess you didn't get the sarcasm ...
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but I think you missed the point of my comment .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say .
I think he's gonna be a great player , but I don't see him being a top 5 player in the league .
I'm sure you can find a way to make it work .

You're not autistic if you don't know what autism means .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it's a good point .
It did not .
It was the same for me last year . I'm not sure why , but I just don't get it .
I think it's just a vocal fry .
I'm not sure if I should laugh at this comment or cry .
Ohhh , I see ! Thanks for explaining it to me !
I'm not sure if you're serious but I think he's going to be the next president of the United States .
I'm sure they're not doing it for the money , but because they have a lot of experience and are willing to learn .
I'm sure you'll be able to find some nice places in the city for free , but that's not what this is about .
I think it's more of a case of him being a narcissist than anything else , but I could be wrong .
I'd like to buy one too !
I think he's a bit too tall for me , but I'm not sure about that .
They're playing like they've been there for years .
I don't know , but I'm sure the answer is infinite .
Because the people who make these things are not smart enough to figure out how to make them better .
That's the best way to get them to understand you !
I'm sure you could find a way to make it work on the Galaxy S4 .
It's a meme .
I'm sure you can find a way to make him happy .
I'm not sure what the difference is between a and a . I've never heard of a dutch speaking person before .
I'm not bitter or spiteful , I just don't like him .
Yeah , I've seen a few people from Trinidad on here .
Thanks ! I'll need it , haha .
I'm not sure what you're talking about ... I've had symptoms for a week and they haven't gone away .
I'm sure they're still there ... just not in the same place as before .
I'm not joking , I'm actually really worried about that too .
I'm not your little one , kid !
You can't do that with a single finger though ...
It's the eyes and mouth movements that make it look like a cat is trying to eat you .
The V1 is pretty good , and the V2 is also very nice .
I think it's because they were going to do it in the first place , but they decided against it after seeing how much money they made from the movie .
I'm not sure if you're being serious ...
I'm not sure what you mean by that but I think it's pretty clear that they don't consider the US to be a nuclear state .
I was thinking more like a big , heavy , metal box that you can't get out of .
You're right , but that's just because they're all made of plastic .
He's a great player , but he's no Kobe Bryant or Shaq .
Yeah , I think that's what they were going for .
Because PEI doesn t have a single store in the entire country .
He's not going anywhere . He's got a ring and he wants to play for his hometown team .
I think it's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski .
I've been doing this for years . It's not a bad gig at all .
I saw one at the one I work at in Indy , but not at a D amp B .
I'm not sure if that was a joke or not but it made me laugh .
You're a robot , duh !
His ult is pretty bad , but it's not that bad compared to other champions'abilities .
It's not even a good idea , it's just a way of making him seem more relatable and less like a caricature .
I'm listening now , thanks !
It's not you . It was a good movie , but I don't think it was that great of a movie .
I think you mean the stone age of tools .
I'm from there ! I was just wondering if it was a local thing or something .
It's a reference to a movie .

I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote you .
I didn't even notice it was a milk , but now I'm going to have to look for it ...
I'm sure he'll be able to afford it , but I doubt he's going to be able to afford the whole thing .
I'm sure you're not the only one who's heard of the band , but I think they were in the middle east for a while before being exiled to Europe .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this comment ...
I'm sure the twin is just as bad .
I'm in the same boat as you !
They're too busy playing Hearthstone and Hearthstone is too busy playing Hearthstone to play Shaman .

It's not like he was going to get any younger anyway ...
Sniffs , I like that .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I think he's dead .
I've been taking magnesium for a while now , it's great !
It was Thursday for me and I'm still here .
I do this too . It's a lot easier to hit with the first swing than the second .
I think it was a little more than that ...
I think that's what happened to me in the movie too !
I'm sure he'll be fine , but I'd like to see him try it on his own .
Justicey is a good one .
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but that was a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that we scored .
It's a good thing you didn't then !
You're not alone in that opinion !
I think you mean a champion who copies another champion .
I think it's more likely that he doesn't know anything about the situation , but is trying to make a joke out of it .
I've tried this but she still eats it .
Lol you're right . I'm not sure why I thought that was an ejection .
I'm a marine biologist and I've never had a girl ask me out .
We thank Russia for their support , but we are not going to give up our territorial waters .

I'm pretty sure that's a woman , and she is blinking .
You're not the only one !
I'm 27 . He's 28 . We're both in the same boat .
You don t have to worry about it . It s just a matter of time before you get sick and die from it .

I'd watch that .
I'd probably just go to sleep .
I'm not sure what you mean by this ?
They're both laughing at the same time , so I'm guessing they're both serious about it .
I'm not going to read it , but I'll be sure to avoid any threads about it .
