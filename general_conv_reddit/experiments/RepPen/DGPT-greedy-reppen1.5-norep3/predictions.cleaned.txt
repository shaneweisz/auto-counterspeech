I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ... I'll have to ask my mom about it later today ! Thanks for sharing , though :D lt 3
I think you mean r iAmVeryCurious .
That's what she said ?
I'm in !
It is a great piece ! And thank you for your kind words :D
He's been pretty solid in the past and he was on our practice squad last year so I'm not sure what you're talking about there ... but yeah , we've had some bad luck lately ! :P Edit spelling error .. sorry guys lolololoollllloooooowwwwwwoooohhhahahahahahhaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeewwooppooooooooaaaaaawwhuhgghtsssiiiiiennnnnngggbbbs
I'm not sure about that , but if you're in the US and have a gun store near by it's probably worth checking out for some good deals on them too ... ? :P Edit spelling error lolololoolllllzzzz ..
It was a preseason match up and they're playing in Edmonton tonight so it should be good to go by then !
That sounds about right , thanks ! :D
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that he's playing . He was a beast last year and this is his first game back from injury ? !
Nice ! I'm at a 9:30 mile right now , but my goal is 10mph or so for me this year ...
I think it's more likely that they'd be blown up .
I think you're right ! I'll edit my post to reflect that thanks for pointing out what I was thinking of wrong :D Edit : spelling error fixed ...
Leif is the best character in this game by far ... I hope they don't change him to a new one though ..
I think so . I don't see him losing to anyone else in the division except maybe Aldo or McGregor and that's not happening either way for sure lol ... but who knows ! haha .. hahahaahahahhaa :D D: d dddeeeepsss :p sssshhhhhhh :P pppffffffftttt : PPPfffuuuuhhhh :P ppfuuuuuuughts :p pppsdfghjkkk
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making a joke ... but I think that is what he was getting at with this post ?
I'm not sure if I should be offended by that , but you're right . It's gross ! :P
I did , but I'm not sure if that's what he was getting at or just a joke about how much money people make in Canada compared with other countries ... hmmmmmmh ..
You're not wrong ... but you are also not right either !
I would too if it was that good ! But no one ever does ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... I hope it's sarcasm because that would make no sense at all lol ! But seriously though : Messi is a legend ?
I think it's the lighting . It looks like a lot of people are standing around and not looking at anything . I'm sure there were plenty to choose from though ! :D Edit spelling ...
I think it's called the Sushi Palace in Ballard , but you can't go there without a reservation or being invited by someone who works at the place ! It was pretty awesome though ...
Yes , but they're not the same thing anymore because of all these new laws and regulations that are being passed around here ! s
Because he's a big guy . For you ...
I have a few tools , but I'm looking to use them more as a last resort .
I think you're right about this but I don't know enough to argue with the facts of my own country so ...
I'm sorry , but your username doesn't work here . You're not a Jedi yet ...
Klass is already a thing in league of legends ...
They're just not good enough to win a championship , and they don't want it anymore because of this . They've got no chemistry with each other at all right now ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but it's a good thing that there are no sexual partners for me to have an affair with ! :D lt 3
I'm not sure what you mean by that ? I don t think he was a student but rather an author who had written on the subject himself ...
I think he's saying that the song was written by a guy who doesn't know how to write songs , and therefore didn t make it into an album cover ... or something like this .. lol jk :P sorry guys lt 3
He's not , he just has the same accent as his brother and cousin who are both from Brazil .
I'm not paying for Spotify , I pay for the service and content on my phone .
Me three ... me four .. and my axe ! :D D:
TIL I'm the only person who watched that . It's one of my favorite shows !
I think you mean'They didn't succeed at all and were just a bunch of losers who got what was coming for them anyway ... ' ? I'm not sure how this works .. lol ! :P Edit : words are hard sometimes xD lt 3
I've had mine for over 3 years and they're still going strong . They are pretty cheap too so you can't go wrong with them !
I think you're right but I don't know enough about Khabib to say for sure that he's not a better fighter or at least more skilled in his own way ... ? ! s Edit : grammar
I've tried it , but the texture is too thick for me to eat with a spoon or anything else . It's just not my thing at all ! :P Thanks though lt 3
I'm going to go with this one !
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad about this , but it's definitely something to consider ! :D Thanks for your input though lt 3
I'm still salty about it . I had a guy who drafted him and he was my first pick , but then got injured ... so sad !
I'm sure you're fine then ! Good luck with your new country and good on ya matey :D
I would . Keucher is a stud and he's been pitching well lately , but you can't go wrong with either of those guys in your league right now ! Good luck man :D DDUH DUUH ...
I'm sure they have some kind of crematory service that will do the job for free or cheap ... I mean what's wrong with paying someone else ? ! :P
He's not even playing for the team anymore ... he was just on loan from us and is now at Sevilla in Spain with his brother . He'll be back soon though ! :D lt 3
You mean you didn't get a good one ? I've had two and they were both pretty bad , but at least the second time around she wasn t as annoying ! :D lt 3
We have a game in November against them , and they're playing us this season too ! It's gonna be fun ... hopefully not as exciting though :P But yeah it'll probably happen eventually hahaa .. lolololllzhahahahaahhhhaaaaahhhhhhhh haaaaaaaaaggggghjngggghjsnsss
I think they're trying out a new format for their shows and I'm not sure if that's what you meant but yeah ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but it's true that the average age of a linux user is about 25 30 years old now ! :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but I'll upvote anyway because this is funny and true ! :D
He did ! He's the one who posted this on Facebook , so I'm sure he got some sweet karma for that post too :D
It's a feature that makes it easier for me , I don't use the app often enough but when i do its just annoying and not worth my time ...
I'm sure he'll be happy to hear that lol ...
Zarya's skin is a bit more than that , but it does have some similarities to Tracers .
I'm sure it was a blast ! I've never been to one of these before so this is my first time going there and they were super chill about me being weird haha :D lt 3333 x3o0ooOoooOOooooohhh ...
I think you mean 6 .
I'd rather have a bunch of guys who can't catch or block than one guy with no hands ...
It's a good thing I have my phone with me at all times ! :D
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that you're right .
I'll take the other half of your Bananas if you don't mind ...
r soccercirclejerk has been a thing for years and it's still going strong !
He's from New York . He was born there , and his parents are from New Jersey so they're probably related to some of us here too ! :D
Corn is a lot better than it used to be . It's not as bad , but I don't think there are any major changes that would make the game worse ... yet ! :P Edit spelling error fixed now lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwwwweweellooooooooooshhhahahahaahhhaaaaahhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeyyayehawweelpuhuohaiiiiiiinnnnnnggggghaaaaaaaal
I think they were just talking about the new jungle item . I don't know if it's a big change , but that would make sense for them not wanting to nerf him again ... right now .. lol ! :D D: lt 3
I know , I was just saying thanks for sharing ! :P
I think it's a place to stay . I don't know what the deal is with Dolore , but if you're interested we can talk about that later on ! :D
It was always that way . It wasn't until recently when they started using QR code as well to show off their products and services in more detail than before ...
That would be an awesome table ! I'd buy it for my room if you know what i mean ... lol :P
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but he's definitely got the look of an old man who just had his wisdom teeth pulled out by a dentist ...
Thanks ! We're really excited to see how this turns out and we hope you enjoy our next project as well :D Thanks again for your feedback on my game's development process ...
He has a better grasp on reality than Trump does , though ...
I'm not saying I agree with them doing so ... But there are edit : spelling error fix'd
I'm not sure , maybe try the new place in the city . It's a bit more expensive than the old one though ...
I was hoping for a shark or something , but I guess that's not as funny ...
I think it was more of a joke than anything else , and I'm not sure why you're being downvoted either ... ?
I have an s7 edge and it happens to me too sometimes but I don't notice any lag or anything that would make you think its something else ... maybe just your phone .. lol ! :D DDUH DUUH DUH duduh duuuuhhhdduurrrrhrnnnnggggghhhhhhhhheeeeheeheeeeeeh heeeheheheeeheee
I'd rather have that than see Cena vs . Reigns at WM30 , but I'm not complaining either way !
Yeah that's what i was thinking too ... it seems like every year there is an elite QB in this draft and they're all overpriced atm lol ..
I think it's because they're made of copper .
That's a good idea , but it doesn't work for me because my support is illiterate and can only read in English ... :P
You're right , but I'm not saying that it wouldn't have been a lot worse for us to do so ...
I'm sure it was ! He's a good boy . I hope he gets to go out with his friends again soon , too ...
It was an execution ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote you or down vote ...
I got my tracking number today and it came from UPS .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take it as a compliment ! Thanks for the laugh :D
I'm sure they did . I was there last night and it's a pretty common topping in pizza places around here , so maybe that is why ? :P
You're right ! It's a shame that we can only have one of these things in the world at once ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is the top comment ...
I think it's because she got buffed in patch 5.2 and then reverted back to being weaker than before that ... I could be wrong though :P Edit spelling ! D: lt 3
I'm okay with this . I'd rather have a new game than another one of the same old games that are just rebranded as something else entirely , though ...
Rogue one was pretty decent , but I don't remember it being that great of an experience as ANH or TFA were for me personally ...
I'm going to make this my new flair for the next few days if you don't mind ! :D
I'm working on it ! :D Thanks for your support .
Because I'm lazy , that's why ! :P But seriously though ... if you're going to do something like this at least make sure the end result isn't too long or boring lol ..
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this was my first thought when seeing your comment ...
You're not going to get much better than this for a keeper in the first place ...
I think it's more like 2 3 days in this case ... but yeah I agree on average for sure lol ..
I think we're all hoping for a tiebreaker game to decide the NFC East's seed next week ... I'm not sure if that would be enough though ! :P Edit spelling error fixed now lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwww
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but Mercy's healing isn't that bad compared with other supports in the game right now ...
I'm not sure if that's a good idea . It could be worse ...
That's the one I was thinking of ! It would be interesting to see if it is possible for an equation with zero or negative signs ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is a thing now ...
I'm sure you can find a way , but it would be really hard since they're all voiced by different people and not just one person per character ... :P But yeah , good luck with your search ! lt 3
You're a wizard Harry .
I agree 100 ! I'm just saying that it's not like the game is dead and dying for everyone else either way ...
It's not like he was going over Roman or anything ...
I'm sure it was more than enough for the two of them ! They were just too lazy with all those extra rooms ... :P Edit : spelling is hard sometimes lolololoolllll
I'm sure the kid is fine now ! He's just not used to being in there for so long ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad for you guys , but at least we have a chance to beat them in Chicago !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but Chrome has a lot more security issues compared with FF .
I'm pretty sure that it has a lot of sugar in there too ... I could be wrong though :P Edit : spelling error fixed for you guys lolololllllz lt 3
I think he is , but you can't really go wrong with any of them if your team needs a tank or healer .
The one that doesn t get pinned .
I'm sure that's why Trump won't be president for another 4 years , right ? s
I think he's talking about falling off of a boat or something like that ...
I think it's a good song , but I don t know if that s what you were going for with your comment ...
I have all of them except for that one , but i still want a snow owl ana skin :D
You're a good man , you know that ? You've got the right idea .
I'm sure it's not a problem , but if you're worried about your bag getting damaged then just take one of each and put that in there too lol :P Good luck with everything though lt 3
Because they're not doing it for free . They have no idea what's going on and are just trying their best with whatever is available at hand ?
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , because there are plenty to be found in the beta and even more so after release ...
I don't think he has a lot to say about it , but I'm sure that his opinions are very popular among Poles and Russians alike ! :D
I don't know , but if it's not too late for me ...
I'm sure that's what they're doing , but I don t think it s enough for him not be in there with us anymore ! He deserves more than just playing music though .. lololollolo lt 3
I'm sorry to hear that . Hope you get better soon ! lt 3 hugs and love from a fellow IBS sufferer :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but that's the way it is here too ...
I think it's more about gambling with your life than playing a game on the casino floor ... but yeah that too !
I'm not even sure what you're trying to say with that comment ... but whatever floats your boat man !
The big one . I'm not sure if that is what you were going for but thanks anyway :D
I've never seen a court side seat . I'm in the upper deck , so it's not that big an issue for me to have them on my own property lol ! Thanks though man :D lt 3333
You can have mine ! I'll take it off your hands for you if that's okay ? :D lt 3
I'm in the same boat . It's a great spot to go for lunch and dinner , but it is not worth going out there on a weekday night ...
I was so excited for a second there , then my heart sank and i just sighed in relief ...
That would be nice but he has already done this before and got away with it so why not try again ? ! s
I'm not sure if it's a bug or intentional , but I've seen people use the same thing to get around this . It looks like they're just using an alt tabbed window ... ? :P Edit : spelling error fix'd
Baszlers a beast though ! I'm surprised he didn't get more than 10 minutes of the fight in his last two fights before getting injured again ...
He's been pretty good , but he hasn't really had a chance yet because of his foul trouble and lack of defense on D . He'll get there though !
I think it's called the'death by lava ' . It was in one of those videos on youtube , I don't remember which though ... but that sounds like something to check out ! :D Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolololoollllloolooowwwwwwoooooohhhahahaahahaaaahhhaaawwaaaaaaaattttuuuuhhhhhhhhheeeeelloooooooooooouughhhheeeeeehauurrrrghhhhhh
I'm sure it's a good idea , but I don t think they would have the budget for that .
I mean , we did that last week ... and then lost by a field goal in overtime against them .. so yeah I guess you're right ? :P Edit : grammar
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic but that goal is one of my favorite goals in football history ! It just makes me so happy to watch ...
I think you're right , but I don't know how much of an impact that would have on the economy or society in general ...
I'm not sure if I should be offended or happy that this happened to me ! :D
I liked the first issue of his run , but it got pretty boring after a while and he just started to get too much into himself for me ...
I've pulled 2 of them , and they were both from the same banner ...
I'm sorry for your loss .
I think it's a good idea , but if we're going by that logic then why not just run up the score instead of trying to get points off turnovers and penalties ... right guys ! srsly .. lolololllzzzsssshhhhhhhhahahahaha :D D: lt 3
I'm ringing now !
I'd give it an 8 10 and that's being generous for something so terrible as Full Metal Alchemist : Brotherhood ...
I think it's a reference to the movie , where he says that . I could be wrong though ...
You're already dead . You don't need that kind of emotion anyway , you'll be fine ! s
I've never seen a cat do it before ! I'm so jealous of your house and the cats in there ...
I'm sure they'll be fine . They're not going to make the same mistakes as before , but it's still an improvement over what we have now ! s
She has two hands , and a lot of practice with the other hand to get it right every time ...
I'm not sure if it s possible to be more disgusted by this comment than me , but that sounds pretty gross ...
Happy birthday to you too , I hope your life is going well and enjoy the rest of it while we wait for our next one lolololoolllll ...
I'm sure it's not too bad , but I'd still like the option of having an actual job instead if just being paid for doing nothing ! :P Thanks though !
You're welcome ! I'm glad it was a good picture to have in your room :D
I'm not sure I'd want them , but they're still pretty cool !
I'm not sure , but I think it's because of the fact that he can't be countered .
I'm not sure if you're joking or just really stupid ... :P But yes it's a reference to something in Mario 64 where he says'Wa haa ah'when his tail wags like this one does .. ? XD xD lt 3333x3dollzzzZs XDDXddxdoxxxyyyoooooooOOooOoYeehNgHHHhhMmmmmmmmmmMMmVeeeeeRrrrRRlTss
I would love to see that in an open world setting ! That's what it should be all about ...
I'd say yes , but you're probably better off with someone else who has more upside and is younger than Bauer .
I think it's a screenshot from the movie . I'm not sure though , but there are some scenes in which he looks like he is actually filming himself doing something ...
I'm pretty sure he was talking about Lebron James Jr and his dad . Not LeBron himself lol ... but I could be wrong though !
And a little bit of the old fashioned way , too !
It was tipped , but he still had control of his feet and made contact with the ball before it hit him in bounds so no TD for that one either way ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I like your username !
I'm sure that's not happening . They're already running low on money , so I doubt it'll be long before their economy collapses again ... or at least becomes more unstable than ever ! :P PPPpppfffffttttsss .. pffftfffuuuuhhhahahahahaaaaahhhaa haaaaaaaa
I think you're being sarcastic , but I'm not sure ...
I'm sure they'll be fine with the new laws in place to protect them from that sorta thing ... s
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by three things ? What are the other two ?
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making a bad pun . I'll take it either way , though ! :D
I remember that . I also recall him saying he would never do business with Russia again if it was a threat to his country's interests and well being ... so what is your point exactly .. lolololll ! s
You could use a third party app that does it for you , but I'm not sure if there are any good ones out right now ...
I think you mean the opposite of that ...
I was yelling Get that ball ! when he got it , but then realized what happened and yelled again to make sure they didn't call back for another play ... lolololllll :D D: ddddddduuuudeee
They did , but they were both too busy being the best in their division for a while now ...
I think he was talking about the fact that she's a synth and not an actual person .
I think it would be cool if you could watch live scores and stuff , but not just highlights or replays from previous games ...
And then they'll have a monopoly on gaming and we can all go home !
I think I'd be more impressed if they were able to find a picture that was actually him in his prime , rather than just one with no context whatsoever ...
I think she's going to be the next big thing in NXT , and it'll probably happen at some point during her career as well ... but yeah .. this was a bummer ! :P lt 3
I'll take one as well !
They get a free one .
Morry was out with a concussion earlier and he's been playing well since then so far this season ...
I thought it was a cat , but I could be wrong ! Thanks though :D
Awesome , thanks for clarifying it's a great update and really helps me out in my daily grinds :D
No , they're going to have a tag team match at the end of it .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think he's saying the cost is more than what it would be worth to buy one at home ... which makes sense ! lol jk .. haha hahaha XD xD lt 3 u bbzzz zuizideeeeekdawgjnxwqyvfghhhheeeeeuuughhhhhhhhahahahhrrrrbsbbbeehcbaaaaahyyoooooopp
Thanks for your suggestion ! I'll check it out , and post back here with any feedback or suggestions you have on how we can improve our site . Thanks again :D lt 3
I know but I'm just saying that's what they said about gyms before and now we're getting them again so maybe there are some changes in how portals work ? ! :D DDDddd ... daaaaaaad .. daaaammmmmmmmmmnnnsss
I think that's what they were going for with this move to get him playing in NA and not China . He was already on their team before joining IMT anyway ! :D DDHahahaha ...
He's not good . He has the worst hands in football , and he can't throw it downfield well enough to make plays .
I'm sorry for your loss ...
It's coarse and rough , irritating ... And gets everywhere !
Yeah he's out . He was in the second round of practice with a concussion and had surgery on his shoulder .
I think it was more about the fact that they were able to use their abilities faster and had a higher chance of getting an assist than other adc's ... ? idk lol .. :P ! xD
I think you mean MJ and Lebron , not LBJ amp Klay Thompson ...
I've been paid for the same amount as well !
I'd say it's about an 8 . It had some great moments , but overall I thought the movie wasn't that great and didn t really stand out to me much from other Marvel movies ... shrugs ! :P lolololloloopsieshouldhavecaredmeowwwwwwoooooohhhahahahaahhaaaaahhhhhhhhheeeeeeheeewwaaaaaaghawwhaaaatttt
I don't know about cpu usage but if you're running any kind offhand programs with a lot more memory and ram than your browser will be faster by far edit !
They already do that with the Canadian dollar , it's called maple syrup or something like that ..
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I do agree with your sentiment !
I'm not sure if that's true or just an urban legend ... but I'll take it ! :D Thanks for the laugh though haha xd lt 3
It's a nice touch , but I think it would be better if he had some sort of metal plate on his back to hold onto while doing this ...
I think the movie was pretty good , but I'm not sure how much of that has to do with Marvel's lacklustre marketing efforts and their inability for diversity ... ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , so I'll just say that people who buy expensive things are usually very stupid about it ...
I'm not sure if he's going to be able do it on a budget though ...
He is the one who made it happen , so yes he deserves some credit ! s
As an American who has been to Singapore and Hong Kong ... it's not even close !
I'm pretty sure that's what he was going for ...
I think they're saying Waterburger .
Thank you , they were really nice people ! They treated me well too so that's a big plus in my book :D
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I hope it's sarcasm because this is a really good analogy and makes sense to me as well ... but who knows ? lolololoolllll .. hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
I'm sure he would have been fine with that , but I don't think it's the same thing as being able and willing to do something like this ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take it either way :P Thanks for the tip though and sorry about that spelling error ...
I'm sorry to hear that . Hope you get some new ones soon ! :D lt 3
I think that's the point of a short show ... to be shorter than the full length episodes ! :D I'm glad you enjoyed it though because there were some really good moments in it too .. lolololo lt 3333 x3ooxxooooooohhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmuuuuhhhhnnnnggggghjkgluglgeeeeewwwwwwzzzsss ?
I agree with you but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have a minimum wage for all employees and not just those who are paid well above their actual pay rate ... ? ! s
I've never had a problem with it , and the only time i have ever seen someone complain is when they were using something like this on their phone ...
I think you're right , I just don't know how to explain the situation better than this ...
You should ! It's a great investment , and it will pay off for years down the road when your kids start making more money than they did before ...
He did that with a shotgun too , but I think it's more of an air rifle than anything else ...
I'm in Canada ... I have no idea why they're charging us for it though .. It seems like a lot more than just internet service fees !
I think it's an owl , but I could be wrong ...
It's not a penalty if it doesn't get called , right ? That rule is in place for all penalties and challenges ...
I think it's a reference to The Last of Us .
I'm sure she'll be happy with that !
I'm not sure what that means , but I'll take it as a compliment ! :D
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry at your comment .. but it is a good one nonetheless ! Have an upvote sir madam !
I think he's more of a security guard than anything else ... I mean the guy has been in movies and stuff like that .. He just doesn't have any friends anymore ! s :P lol jk lt 3 u bbz xoxo
I'm not sure what you mean by stooping ? He didn't do anything wrong in this case ... he did nothing right either .. but still better than Trump or Clinton lolololllll lt 3 u bbz 2x 4 lyfeh 4g tm8r
I'm a dad and I've never heard of it , but that's because we're not really into cartoons or anything like that ...
I'm sorry , I don't understand . What is this from and where can you get some for free in Germany or something like that ... ? Edit : Thanks guys !
I'm not sure I understand the reference ... but thanks for letting me know anyway :D
Reciprocal aid . I don't think it's worth using on a healer , but if they have good HP and MP regen then that would be nice for them too ! :D Edit spelling ...
And that one time when we signed a player who was actually decent ...
I think you're right , but I'm not sure if he's being serious or just a troll ... Either way though :P
I'm sure they do . I've seen a lot more people who don't know what's going on in the world than those that actually think this stuff happens all the time ...
I'm hoping it's an own goal , but I don't think so ...
He's a good actor , but I don't think it would be wise for him not have his own show on the CW or whatever they call it now .. lol ! :P
I'd be down for that . We've been playing great defense all year long though so it's not really an upgrade from what we're used too now anyway !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll . I hope it's both , though ! :D lt 3 hugs and kisses for everyone who is feeling down today ...
I'm sure you're right but I can only imagine how much worse it'd be with him on there ...
I'm sure you'll find it eventually ! I know , right ? :D
I'm sure they'll find a way around it , but the crowd will still boo them anyway because their team is garbage and nobody cares about basketball anymore lolololloloooloo ! s
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this comment ...
I'm going with Argentina . I've been following them since they were in the WC and their fans are awesome ! They're my favorite team by far :D
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that you're right about the second one , but it's still a great movie !
I'm pretty sure that's the case with most people in general ...
He's going for the double entendre , I think ?
I'm not saying they're bad but I think the shield operators have been nerfed . They were fine before and now they've got a huge buff on them too ...
I've never seen anyone put a sauce like that , but maybe they do ... or at least have some kind of condiment for dipping them into something else ! :D Edit spelling is hard sometimes lolololoolllll
I'm not saying it's bad or anything but that doesn't mean you can't have your own opinion on things ! :D It just means we're all different people with our opinions haha ...
I'm pretty sure that's a joke , but I'll take your word for it because the internet is weird sometimes ...
You're a good man , and you know it !
I think that fight would be great , but I don't see how they could afford to pay him more than 50k per appearance if he was fighting for free ... ? ! s Edit : grammar
I think that's the one . Thanks ! :D
I'm not sure what you mean by this but I agree with your sentiment 100 and will be staying out of there for the time being ! Thanks though :D lt 3
I know , but she's from Belgium and lived in Netherlands for a while before moving to the US where her parents are both American citizens ... so I'm assuming that counts ? :P Sorry OP though .. lolz lt 3
I'm pretty sure that's a joke . I think they're just trying out their new logo for this video , and didn't want anyone thinking it was real or something ... lol ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed .. hahaahahaahahhhaa
I think it's a bug that they're trying to fix . It was happening in ranked yesterday and today too so maybe its just an isolated issue ? Idk though ...
I'm not being heartless I was just saying that it's a downgrade from beating Iceland and getting knocked out of the tournament by Iceland at home .
I got it from someone else . Thanks though :D
I think he's a great player and I'm glad to see him doing well in Italy ! He was my favorite Italian CB for years now :D
I care more than you do ... I'm not even sure what that means but it's funny to me nonetheless ! :D Edit : spelling mistake fixed lolololoolllllooooo lt 3 u guys ..
He's the best coach in the league by far though ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but I think he's actually the head of our recruiting department now ... so that would be pretty funny ! :D Edit spelling error fixed it for me lolololoolllllzzzzyyyyooooooouuuuuhhhhhhhahahahahaohhhaaawwwwwwaaaaaahhhhaaayeeeeeewwaaaaghhhhhhajjagghgghgggaheeeeyoowoooosh
I agree , and the fact is they are not going to change anything about this game if people keep abusing them for no good reason ...
I think she's still pretty good , but the show is just so much better without her around now and then ...
I'm sorry for your loss . I hope you can find someone who will help with this issue and that they are able get it fixed quickly !
I like his costume more than any other in the MCU but that's just me ...
I'm not French , but I don't think it's that bad . It was a bit of an overreaction though ...
I'm pretty sure it's not possible unless he has some sorta super power like telekinesis which is basically impossible without any powers at all ... right now I think we can safely assume no though .. lol ! :P Edit spelling error xD XD D
I'm not even going for the puns anymore ... I just want them all gone !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think he means that they should be able to play them at launch without having a subscription . Not necessarily exclusive games ...
I'm pretty sure it's going to be the same as last time they tried this with The Walking Dead and then got cancelled because people didn't like that show ... or something .. I dunno really lolololoolllll :P Edit : spelling error hahaahahaahahhhaa
I did . I loved them both , but they were different in my opinion and not as good as the first one was for me personally ...
We have a lot of neutrality in our military too though :P We just don t like being called that for some reason lolololoolllll I love this game tho lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic ... but this works for me too ! :D
He's not , he was just on a commercial break and didn't want to interrupt him with his headset mic talking about football again lolololloloooloo
I'm pretty sure that's what they're going to do with him and his wife in season 2 of The Leftovers .
I think it's a combination of the fact that he was in such an awkward position , plus his momentum . He probably didn't even realize what happened until after they were done filming ... lol ! :P Edit : spelling error ..
I think they'll be fine with the Chargers being in San Diego , but I don't see them moving to LA anytime soon ... unless it's for some reason like that one time ? ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolololoolllll
He's on the bench , so he won't be scoring any goals for us this season ... but you can have him back if you want !
You say cat .
I'm in a different part if town than that one ! But it's still pretty close to where we are now :P
I've never had LaCroix but I'm going for that next time ! Thanks so much :D lt 3
Rest is still there though ...
I would have been . I'm a fan of his and he's an amazing coach , but it was just too much for me to handle at the time ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think that's a pretty good point to make in general ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... I hope it's sarcasm because that would be hilarious ! :D But seriously though .. It was a great game and I loved playing it too lolololoolllll XD xdxdxddxxdXDD D: lt 3333
Because he was blind and deaf , duh ! s
I don t think so , but that s because they re not really a thing anymore and the kids are too young to know what you mean by graduation ceremony ... yet ! :P lololollolo
I think you mean inside the box ...
It is a great game and the story is amazing ! It has some of my favorite characters from other games in it too :D
He's been doing it for years . He was a pro wrestler in the 80s and 90 ' s , but has had multiple injuries throughout his career .
I'd rather have a better product than that , but I'm not complaining about Turner's terrible programming either way !
It's not like they're playing the same team that lost to Ole Miss or anything ... s ? I'm kidding , of course it was an awful loss for them too ! :P But still ..
You're both right , but you should probably feel proud of yourself for being so brave and selfless !
I think it was the latter . I'm not sure how much they've improved but we're definitely better than last year and this season so far !
I'm not sure if you're serious , but Varian was already a thing in the beta ...
I'd be down to play some games on the Hong Kong server !
NATO has been a joke for years now ... It doesn t matter what the US wants or needs from Russia if they don t want them there anymore than we do ! s
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take it either way !
I'm sorry for the inconvenience ! My mom is a nurse and she's going through some stuff right now so we'll see how this goes ...
He's already been champ for a while now , and he was in that picture with Cena at WM30 ... so I don't think it'll be too long before they do something like this again ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwwwaaaaaaahhhahahahahhaaawwaaaaahhhhheeeeeeheeewoohhhhhhuhuuuughhhueehuhuhuhhuuhuhuuuhuh
I was talking about highway driving ... but yeah that makes sense too !
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted for this ... It's true and they do charge a lot of money to get around traffic jams .
No but they are a bunch of thugs who don't care if you get shot or not because it's your right and he doesn t have that either ... srsly though ..
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry at this comment , but it's true nonetheless :D
I think it's more likely that they'll introduce her as an antagonist in season 2 , but I'm not sure if we will see them do so this time around ... yet ! :D Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolololoolllll
I'm not sure what you mean by that but it's a good thing to know !
I think it's more of an homage to what they did with TNA . They're trying their best , but I don't see them doing anything special for this one either ... ? ! s
It was a great movie , and one of my favorites from last year ! It really is just about everything you could want in a sci fi horror film :D
It is . I have a few of them and they're all terrible at doing anything , even when the person in front doesn t see what s happening ...
Because it's easier to eat .
I'm not saying they are , but there have already been rumors of them coming out with new consoles in 2017 and 2018 so ...
They've already canceled it before and they're still making money off people buying their games on Steam ... I don't think that's going to happen here either way .. :P Edit spelling ! D: D DD
Because it was the right call , and he didn't touch him at all ...
I think he means that the people who don't believe in God , but still fight for their own glory .
I did , and I'm not a fan of it either ... but that doesn't mean he can't be funny or entertaining to listen too !
You're not supposed to pick them up ! They are just there so you can get some money and stuff from your local butcher shop or whatever ... lololollolooolooowwwwwwoooooohhhahahahaha hahahahaaaahhaa ohhhhhhhh my god that was funny haha :D lt 3
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I'll take your word for it :P
I'm sure they'd love it ! :D
He's been playing well lately . He was on fire in preseason and he has looked good since then too , but I think it is more of his age than anything else ...
I'm 29 ... I knew about them at least 10 years ago lol ..
I think that's the point of this video ... to show how fast you can flip a car in real life ! :D
I'd appreciate a pm as well ! Thanks in advance :D
We won it last year though ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious but it's actually closer to 50 60K now ...
I think the only other one is a movie called'A Million Ways to Die in the West ' , but that's not really an actual comedy either ...
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this is my first time seeing a reference to it in this sub ...
I'm glad you're not a dad ! :D
I think it's a reference to the movie The Conversation .
I'm a huge fan of surfs up , but I've never seen the movie ... is there any good ones ?
I know , but I'm saying that's why he didn't say anything about it in his post ...
I'm sure you're right but I don't think it would work out that way ...
He was a governor . He got elected to be Mayor of Phoenix , AZ and then he became President in Arizona after being Governor for so long ...
He's a good guy . He just has no idea how to use the force properly and is not very bright or creative with his powers either ...
I'm not sure what that is . I just know there's an r nfl thread about the patriots and how much we love them but no one ever comments in here ...
I was just thinking that , I remember those days ...
They're still there . They just don't have the same amount of money to spend on tickets as other teams do , so it's not like their fan base is dying out ... yet ! :P Edit spelling error ..
I'm sure they would have said yes , but I don't think it's worth the hassle of getting them back on their word if that was what happened ... ? :P !
Ekblads been playing well lately , but I agree with you on the other two guys ...
I was just thinking that ! I love the way they all look at each other when it happens ...
I'm from Michigan and I've never seen a salt life sticker before , but it's definitely not an uncommon thing here in Ohio ...
She's a traitor to the people who elected her !
I'm not sure , I've never done them . But if it's something like a cable row or planks then maybe try those instead of the barbell rows and see how they work out for ya ! :D D: P
My mom did this with her husband's ashes when he died a few years ago ... I think it was his wife who had them cremated ? Not sure though !
I'm still waiting for a new season ...
I'm pretty sure they're just giving away their own Prime frames . I don't know why , but that's what happened in my case at least :P
It's not you . It was a great match for sure but I think there were better ones in that tournament to be honest ...
I'm not sure if that was a joke or just really stupid ... I hope so though ! :D
I think that was his point , to make you laugh and not cry at the same time !
I did ! It was a great read and very informative as well ...
I'm sure they have a lot more than just the one mosquito . They're probably all over that area too though ...
I think it was around 30k . I'm not sure though , but that would be a lot for an AAU school like ours ...
I'm sure they're just trying their best ! I'll give them that ...
I'm glad you liked it ! I hope your stomach is feeling better now , and that the rest of your day went well too :D lt 3
I can't tell if this is serious or not ... but I'm going to go with yes because it's funny and topical at the same time ! :D
Yeah , but they're not going to win the title this year ...
They should have to be warned by Goodell , but I don't think they would do it if there were no consequences .
I think you're right on that one ... I just don't see how they can be considered a top 3 TEs in this league without having to include Dez Bryant or Odell Beckham Jr .. ? ! lolololoolllll
I'm glad you enjoyed it ! :D
I'm only 19 so maybe my parents watched it when i was younger ... But yeah its been around since at least 2000 or 2001 if memory serves me right ! :D Edit spelling lolololoollllloooooowwwwwwooohhhooooshhhhhhahahahaahaaaahaaa xdxdxddxxdaaaaaaadbzgghhhhheeeeektsssdfwfjrvbsqycvs
I'm sorry for your loss ... but at least you got a good deal on the jerseys !
No worries at all man thanks again and keep up the good work :D
I'll try to get a copy of the book . It's not that hard , and if anyone wants one they can just google for it ! Thanks so much :D lt 3
I think he means that you can't use them on each other , but they're still pretty easy to find and farm for coins .
It was pretty bad but not as awful as you'd expect from HBO or Showtime in terms of quality and plot development ...
Because they're both good players ? I don't think it's a bad idea to have them in the squad for now though ...
I think you mean 2nd , but I agree with your sentiment nonetheless !
I think it's a pretty good idea , but the fact that they're so far away makes me wonder if there are any other places in Germany where we could go ... ? :P Edit spelling error ..
I'm not arguing . I am just saying that it's a good thing to do and he should be praised for doing so in the first place ! :D DDDddd ...
I think it's funny that you're downvoted for saying something about losing , but upvotes are given out when someone is actually wrong in an argument ... I'm not sure what happened there ? ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolololoollllloooooooloo lt 3 u bbzkitties
Because it's a business and they want to make money ? I don't know , but that doesn t mean you can just go around telling people how much your taxes pay them ...
I'm not saying PC has been better than consoles . I am saying that's what people are complaining about on here and in other places when there aren't any problems with console versions ... ? ! s
I think they were saying it was a blowout because there weren't any fans in attendance , not just people who showed up to watch . I could be wrong though ... lol ! :P Edit spelling error .. hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
Because it's a race . It doesn't matter how long they take , if you're not racing then why are there any commercials at all ! s
I think it was a joke . He said something like'It is impossible for me to understand this sentence ! ' and then proceeded with his usual style :P Edit : grammar
You're not alone , but you are definitely not a minority ! :D
You're not alone .
I'm pretty sure it was more of an attempt to be funny than anything else , but I guess you're right ...
I think you mean Barr is a better version than Tread well , but I'm not sure about that one ...
I think you're right ! I was thinking that maybe there were some kind if coating or something to protect from being scratched by snow and stuff like this ... but nope .. nothing :P Thanks for clearing up my confusion though lol XD lt 3
I'm sorry , but I don't understand what you're trying to say here ? What's wrong with bee keeping if they are doing their job well and enjoying the animals that live there ... etc .. ect ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwww
I'm sorry to hear that . I hope you have a good day ! :D lt 3 hugs
I think it's more like 8 10 , but yeah ...
I'm not sure what you mean by this ... I don't think any game is going to be better than FF7 or 8 in terms if storytelling mechanics .. ? ! s Seriously though :P
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but I think it's a good thing that people don't consider the 80s and 90 ' s as new wave music anymore ...
I don't know about that but I'm sure they do in other countries like France and Germany where it's legal for people with mental illness or drug problems to be witnesses ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling . I hope it's a troll though because that would be hilarious and sad at the same time ...
I'm still waiting for the day when I can get an emerald from one of my gems ...
I call them moonshine roofs , but I'm not sure if that is correct or not ...
I'd say ACC has a better reputation than SEC , but that's just me ...
It's the way it was shot that made you feel uncomfortable ? I'm not sure what to tell ya ...
Lockhart was the best ! I loved him so much as a kid and now ... well ... yeah ..
I'd like that more than anything else ! :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but I've seen this exact same picture posted a few times before and it's always been funny to me ! :D lt 3 u bb
I'm sure they're already out there , but I'd like one with more than just the word'shredder'on it ! :P
It is in the US . I've never heard of anyone calling them dresses before , but they're definitely dressy enough to be considered robes here !
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that my arcane was rejected ... but it wasn t a good one either way :P
I'm in . I'll be there at 7:30 !
I'm pretty sure they're based out of the US but I could be wrong about that ...
I think we all are edge prime now ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , because I think it's pretty funny that someone would downvote a comment like yours ...
Yeah I'm sure you are correct about this one ...
It's a meme . It started in r soccer and spread to other subs , but it was never popular enough for people outside this subreddit or on here that I know personally ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll ... but I like your idea ! :D
He's a great guy and he deserves to be in this league ! He was one of our best players last year too so that makes him special for me as well :D lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll but that sounds like an awful lot of salt to me ...
I think it's a good idea for them to do this though ... I mean they're not going anywhere with that franchise and now they have an audience ! s
He didn't do anything , he was just in front of him and had to go around him for a corner change ...
It's a good deal , but it doesn't have any of Intel's features that are useful to me . It has some nice features like 4GB RAM , though !
I'd watch that match ! I love me some steak and pancake sandwiches , but they're too much of a hassle for my stomach :P But yeah ... maybe we could do something like this instead .. lolololooolooohhhahahaahahaaaahhhaaawwwwwwaaaaaaaaghhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeewwoooooowoooowoooooooooaoiouuuuuhhhhhhhhhhghgghggghjghghguHHHWUZ
The queen has a lot more power than the prime minister though ...
I think that's a good way of looking it . It could be either team is playing well or they're not and the other one isn't doing so hot right now ...
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
He's not even done one for The Last Crusade .
Clarkson is a good defender , but he's not the best at it and his defense has been suspect this series for some reason ...
I'm not sure what I would do without my hands ...
I have no idea what you're talking about ... The PS4 has 4TB of storage and it runs at 60fps with all settings maxed out ? ! s Edit : spelling error fixed
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic ... but that game was a blast ! It's one reason why i bought it on steam for my brother in law who loves games like this :D DDDddduuuuhhh ..
He's still in jail for fraud and he got out a few months ago , but I think it is safe to say that his time at CIG has come to an end ... :P
There is , it was just renamed to the Paris . It used be called the Parisian .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ... I'll go with both , though ! :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic ... but it's a good thing we have this week off to get our mind blown by all of these new things happening around us :D lt 3 u bbzkitties 2u2meh3s4g5e7yw8r6f9d1cjn0mqxv
I'm glad someone got it ! :D
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this ...
It's not bad , but the burgers are pretty average and they're all overpriced for what you get in a burger place like that .
I'm sorry for your loss ... but at least they're not in NA anymore !
I think it might be more about not being able to properly balance while lifting with one hand in front or behind you ... but who knows ! :P Edit spelling error ..
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I'll take either one , though !
I think it's a remix of the same track . I could be wrong though , but this is definitely not from the original Red Flag Song ...
Awesome , thanks for being awesome about it all :D lt 3
I'm sorry for your loss !
I meant for me personally , I don't want to see any more movies after this one ends lol but it's just a thought ! :D
Because it's a socialist subreddit .
I think that's what he meant by the two of them being in a movie together ... but yeah they're both great actors ! :D
I was thinking more like a young Jennifer Lawrence or something ... but I guess that works too lol :D Thanks for your comment though lt 3
It's a school that has an underground parking garage , so it doesn't have to be accessible from outside . It just needs some sort of access for students and staff alike ! :D Edit : spelling error ...
I'm sure they had plenty left over from when you guys were still on about your fries being too spicy and not enough saltiness ... right up until then I guess .. lolololllll XD xDx D: lt
I'm a big fan too ! He's got that old school , classic rock sound to his voice and he has such an infectious smile when you listen closely ...
I thought he was great as the villain , but his performance is so overrated and boring that you can't even tell what's going on anymore ...
You're not alone , my friend !
He is also one of my favorite characters in any game ever , so I'm glad he got some love here ! :D
I think it's a great idea , but I don't know if the people who are going to watch will be interested in watching boxing or not ... ?
I'm sure you'll get plenty of them in the future !
I'm not sure what the point is . I was just trying to get out and see how far it would take me before someone got hurt or something like that ...
I think that's what I was thinking too . Loki is a great character , but he doesn't really fit the theme as much as Excalibur does .
He was already suspended for that hit last year ...
I think it's a good thing . It makes me feel like there is something going on with him and he doesn't want to be alone anymore ! :D lt 3
I'm not even mad , I was going to say something like this ... but then again it's Kentucky so there are no rules about what we can and cannot do ! :P lolololloloooloo
I think so . I'm not sure though , but it's a good guess based on the number of buildings and what they're doing with them now that are being built there ...
I'm pretty sure that's a joke , right ? Right ... guys .. Guys ?
I'm not gonna argue with you on this one ... but it's the best title ever ! :D
I'm sure you can't be serious .
Scout's got no guts , he'll just get shot by his own teammates and die from it anyway !
I'm not seeing anything either , but I don't think that's a problem for you since your post is in r androidcirclejerk ... ? :P Edit : Nevermind ! It works now lol thanks guys lt 3
The Irish don't even know what an escargo is !
I'm not sure if that would be considered natural , but I'll take it ! :D Thanks ! lt 3
I hate it too , but not as much because of how long it takes to get there and back from the parking lot ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote .
He is going to be so much fun ! I can't wait for this film :D
I wore a shirt with that on it once , and I was so happy !
Because he is fun and easy for new players , but hard to master ?
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious . Either way it's a good thing we have this sub for people like us ! :D
I'm glad you like the map ! I've been working on a few more , but this one is definitely in my top 3 for sure :D Thanks again ! lt 3
That's a good idea , but I'm not sure if it would be safe for me to do that ... :P But thanks !
I've had a few of those moments . It's not fun , but it happens to me all the time ! :D
EDG edg edgy meme team ? I'm down for that !
Because the state of texas is bigger than oklahoma .
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll . If it's both , then yes ...
Because it's not an excuse for eating at work or going home early if you're on leave from your job ... but I'm sure there are other reasons too ! :P lolololoolllll
Fallout 3 . It's my favorite game of all time !
You can still apply for it , but you'll have to wait until next year's class starts in January ! Good luck on your search though :D I hope everything works well with ya lt 3 hugs and kisses ? xoxo
The bench is still there . The only thing that changes are who starts at 1B and 2nd base respectively in a platoon with the starters .
I have a charger in my car that I use for music or podcasts so it's not an issue at all ! :D But yeah ...
You can get the X for like 100 more . It's not worth it unless you're looking at getting an HDR TV or something similar though IMO anyway ! :P Edit spelling error lolololoolloli
I'm sure they have a lot of storage space for all that salt and pepper ...
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've seen a lot of people say that the gator is actually dead and just lying there in pain ... so maybe ? :P Edit : spelling ! D: D
You're right I was thinking of Nevada or Arizona but you are correct that there's no real reason for them not wanting Californians in their state anymore than they do now ... ? ! s
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad about this ... but it's probably both ! :D
Ah , I see ! Thanks for the clarification :D
I think you're right , but that doesn't mean they can't be confused ! :P
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this is my first thought .
I'm afraid of you ! I am a ghost and your mother was murdered by the devil in her sleep last night ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making a joke about the fact that Mark Twain was an author who supported grants families ... but I'll take your word for it ! :P Thanks though .. lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwwwwweeeeellooooooooooweewuuhhhahahahahaohhhhhhhaaahaaawwhaaaaaat ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but it was an archer reference from Archer and he said this in one of his episodes on netflix ...
I do this all the time , and I'm a guy ... so it's not that big an issue for me ! :D But yeah .. It happens to everyone sometimes lololollolooolooowwwwwwoooooohhhahahaahahaaaahhhaaawwaaaaaaaattttuuuuhhhhhhhhheeeeeeewwhooooshiiiiiit
I'm pretty sure you're right , but I don't know enough about the subject to correct anyone else on this one ...
It's pretty good ! I've only played it once but that was with friends and they were having fun together too :D
That s what happens when your parents are dead and all they have left is their memories ...
I think it's more that they're not teaching anything about Jesus Christ in particular and are just showing off his miracles to show how much faith people have for him ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad about those ties ...
I think it's just the way they're set up . I'm not sure though , but that might be why some people don't like them as much ...
It's a good thing that it doesn't have to be in orbit , then !
I'm pretty certain they're talking about children's movies , which are generally aimed more towards adults than kids ... so no one would think a kid could enjoy this film if he wasn't an adult ! s
I think the process is more fitting , but I like that one too !
I loved junkrat on that map ! It's just so much fun for me as well :D
I think it's more of an evolutionary trait than anything else , but I could be wrong about this one ! Thanks for the input though :D lt 3
I'm not sure what's going on here ... but I think it might be the fact that he has no legs and his arms are broken at the bottom left corner .. lol ! :D D: lt 3 u bbz
I think you mean defense isn't broken , but offense and special teams aren t working out for them either ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but it's a great way of getting out there !
Breen 6 was there too ! He's a good guy though so he'll probably come back soon enough ...
I'm not sure , but I think they're from a butcher . They were pretty cheap too !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I don't know enough about him to tell , but he is a very good player and has been for years now ...
Neymar's performance is a lot better than his last game , but he still got robbed in that match for sure !
I think it was the one in downtown Chicago , I don't remember exactly though ...
I agree with you on the first two but not so much for the third one ...
They do , but it's usually for parking violations or other minor infractions like littering and such ...
I'm a father of three and I can confirm this is true !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take your word for that one ! :D
I loved both versions equally ! The Penguin's and Rocket Launcher are my favorite parts about the movie though ...
I think it's a bit of both . Portugal is more likely to get Portuguese than England , but I don't know about that one ...
I'm not a fan of the new system , but I think it's great that they're trying something different and are making sure their badges work properly now !
Oh , I didn't see it there ... my bad lol :P Thanks though man !
I think it's a good thing , but I'm not sure if they're going to do anything about it now ...
I'm a wood worker too , and it's awesome !
They're like a shark that's been trained by sharks , but with more teeth than you can imagine !
I think it's 3 , but I'm not sure if they're all publicly funded or privately run ...
All of them . All at once !
I think that is called a bulldog , or something like this in English speaking countries ... I'm not sure though ! :D Edit : It was actually called an ole'bollie kick haha ..
I think that was a different one , but I'm not sure ...
I think you mean the Michael Jordan of League Of Legends ? s
I don't know , maybe CRS is just better than TSM ? :P But yeah that's a possibility too lol ..
I'm not sure , but I think it's only for the US .
I'm glad to hear that ! It was a bit of an odd experience for me too but it wasn't bad at all and made sense in context with what happened haha :D Thanks again though lt 3
I'm sorry to hear that . I hope you find what's important and happy !
That's what I thought it meant . Thanks !
I was there too , it's a great show and I'm glad they're still touring with their new album coming out soon :D
Because they have been for decades . They are the most stable country in Asia and Africa , along with China and India .
I think it's both ... but I'm not sure what else could have happened that would cause such an event in the first place ..
It was just an example of how you can use words that are not meant . It doesn t mean anything other than what I said though ! :D Thanks for your input anyway lt 3
You're a good man .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed of this .
I love Cemetery man , but I think it's a bit too long for me to watch again after seeing the movie in theaters ...
You're not alone , friend !
I think you mean Chang's team is better than the one that was in NA .
I think you mean blind to love ...
I think you mean 3.5 fg's per game ?
They did , but it was a different time and people were more interested in their own stories than theirs at that point so there wasn't much interest to begin with ... ? :P I dunno .. shrugs Maybe not really though ! lolololoolllll XD xD lt 3
I'm calling this one as well , but I think she'll be a bit more of an ally than that ... maybe even just some kind if support ? Maybe not necessarily allies though .. lol ! :P lt 3
I think she has a few . I'm not sure though ...
They're not bad , but I think they look better without them IMO ...
He's not even rich ! He just has an extra 100k in the bank from selling drugs on eBay ...
I'm going to use it as an accessory . It's not like the other rings , but it is useful and can be used on any character that has one of those accessories !
He's also not the only one who has been accused of being an alcoholic , and he is still in rehab for his alcoholism .
Because they're the best shape for a square .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take your word for it because that's what happened to me and my friend who got hired there ...
I think the tiebreaker is head to heads . So they'd both have a better record than us , but we're still in first place because of our wins over them and vice versa ... I'm not sure though .. lol ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed it's correct now hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
I'm reading the first issue now ! It's really good ... but a bit slow at times for me to keep up with all of these characters'stories .. lol :P Thanks though man lt 3333
I'm not sure what you're talking about . I've seen people say that before and they were right , he was just being sarcastic ...
I don t think we will either , but I m sure they would be happy to have us as allies if it meant getting rid of the US and Israel's hegemony over them ! s ... wait .. ?
I have that one too , it is so cute :D I'm going for the red one with the big wheels haha
She is also an alcoholic who has no respect for women in general ... I don't think she cares about them as people either way though .. lol ! edit : spelling error fix'd upvote
I think you're on to something . Time is a flat circle , so it's possible that there are no clocks in space or time at all !
He's also the best at making people hate him .
I think it has more to do with his age than anything else , but I agree that there are a lot of factors at work here as well ...
He's a producer . He was on set for this episode of The Last Podcast With Anthony Bourdain .
He didn't . He said that they were all at least 1.5 hours long , and then went on to say how much time passed between them when he won .
I've had it happen to me in my Drapeys and I was pretty sure they were going to explode when I hit them with the explosion damage .
I'm sure there are some out there , but I don't think they're very common .
I've never seen that one but I'll check it out ! Thanks for reminding me to watch this again haha :D Edit : It's on Netflix now if you're interested in watching it there ... lolz ? LolZzzzzzzz .. XD xdxdxdd
It's not that bad , but it gets old after awhile and you get used to the same jokes over and again ... I'm sorry for your loss ! :D lt 3 hugs
As someone who lives on campus at UTA ... me too !
I agree , but he did have some great performances in those movies ! He also had an amazing voice acting job on The Last of Us too ...
I'm sure they could find a way , but it's not like the ministry is going anywhere anytime soon anyway ... right ? Right guys .. ? Guys ! I think we're done here folks :P s
I'm not a person !
I agree , it looks great ! But that's not what this sub is about lol ..
The ref's union would be happy with that , too !
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed .
Ice hockey is a lot more physical than soccer , and it has better players for sure though I don t think we would be able too well against them either way ... :P Edit : spelling ! D: lt 3
That's a good point , I didn't even consider that ! Thanks for pointing it out to me though :D
I thought the same thing , but I'm not sure why that's an unpopular opinion ... It just wasn't for everyone !
United Statesian is the most common term I've seen , but it's also used in a lot more contexts than that .
I think he means that if they get knocked out of EL , it's not luck but skill or something like that ? I'm no expert on football though ... :P Edit spelling ! D: lt 3
I'm sure they'll find a way ... I mean there are only so much ways you could make this joke and still not get banned for being racist or something like that .. right ? ! s
I don't really have a favourite . I like the ones that are easy and cheap , but also taste good with milk or yogurt ! :D
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious . Either way , it's hilarious ! :D
I think they're just trying out new things . I'm sure there will be more in the future though !
I'm not sure if you're serious , but he's actually pretty good . He just doesn't have the best jumper or anything like that though ...
I'm sure they'll find a way ... I mean it's the internet after all ! s
Ichiro is on the DL with an injury ...
I was expecting it to be the same as every other time someone posts something like that , but nope ! It's different and hilarious in its own way :D
I did , and I'm not sure if it's the same account or a different one but there is no way to tell without looking at my history ... ? :P Thanks ! Edit spelling error fixed now lolololoolllll
I've been doing this for years , it's so much fun !
Because it has a good community and people like you are the reason why .
It's been pretty bad . We've had a few good runs but they're mostly just short yardage plays and penalties that don't really help us win games either way ...
The senate is not going to be that bad . It's just gonna get worse and worst as time goes on ... I'm sure they'll find something eventually though ! :D D: lt 3
I think it's more like getting hit in both eyes and having your head crushed by an impact would be pretty bad for you ...
I'm sure you'll be able to ! You just have a lot of work ahead and it's not like the rest is going anywhere anyway ... right ? Right guys .. Guys ? :P
It's not even out in cinemas , and I'm sure there are plenty of critics who haven t watched it either way ...
I think you mean AY ZUZ UZ
I'm interested ! I'll PM you my address and we can discuss it there ? Thanks for doing this by the way :D
You can't do that . You're not a farmer , you don t know what s in your food !
I'm sure they're just jealous of your money , but I think you look great ! Keep it up man :D
I've never had an issue in my experience but I'm not sure what to tell ya ... maybe try asking someone else ?
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I agree with your point and would like a source for this claim as well ! Thanks in advance :D Edit : spelling error fixed it's correct now ...
I'm pretty sure that's a joke about how Americans are so obsessed with their food they don t even know where else we could get alcohol in America ? Idk ... maybe not really though lolololllll ! s lt 3rp
I'm sure you can , but it's not like the mods would care ...
I'm not sure what that means . I've never used Edge , but Bing's search engine seems pretty slow for me on my Surface Pro 2 .
I think they're pretty cool . I like them a lot more than our normal ones , but it's not really an unpopular opinion here in Seattle at least ...
Yes , but it's not a good way to learn . It can be very dangerous if you don't know how to use your arms properly or are clumsy with them ... etc .. Etcetera ! :D D: P
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll . I hope it's both ! :D
I'll try that thanks :D I'm not sure how much they're going for though ... maybe like 100 ? haha but yeah i'd love an animal of his own lololollolooolooowwwwwwoooooohhhahahaahahaaaahhhaaawwaaaaaaaattttuuuuhhhhhhhhheeeeewwhooooshiiiiiit
Because he's the best ?
I think they stopped because people complained about how much time was spent on them instead making more animated movies or something like that ... idk though lol ! :P Edit spelling is hard sometimes xD .. XD lt 3
I feel bad about my lack of knowledge on these shows ... but thanks ! :D
He's a big guy , but he doesn't weigh more then 200 pounds ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this isn't a thing .
I didn't think it was that big of a surprise tbh but I guess people were expecting him to be on the album and he's just been busy with school stuff lately ... shrugs :P ! Haha yeah ..
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I think it's pretty clear what he meant by this comment : If Russia is involved then yes , treason .
I have a mini daschund too , he is only 2 months old and I love him so much :D
I'm sure you'll find a way to make money off of it , but the ad revenue is going down as well so they're not gonna do anything about this one either ! s
It's not that bad , but the ending is so disappointing and doesn t really make sense in context of what happened to the characters after they were rescued from the island ...
I'm not sure if that is good enough ... but whatever works right now lolololoolllll :D lt 3
I thought he was a meme himself ...
I'm sorry to hear that !
I'm not sure , but it's probably because you're on the internet . You can use your phone or something to get around that requirement if needed ! :D
I'm not sure what to think about this . I mean , he's got two arms and all ! But that doesn't make him an animal ?
I'm sorry , but it's not a good joke . It doesn t make sense and is just plain wrong in the context of this sub ...
I'm not too worried about that lol but if you're going for an extra 10k feathers then yeah go ahead ! :D
He's not . He just has an old phone that he borrowed from his dad and is using to call the Avengers .
I think it's a fan that got thrown out of the stadium for being too loud during his speech , but I could be wrong on this one ...
It was a deflection . The ball went in front of him and he didn't even touch it , so no penalty for that either way ...
I'll take that bet .
I'm sure she's already on her way there , just waiting for a good opportunity ...
I'm a fan of their fries and shakes !
I'm glad you're here .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this is my first time playing a game like WoW , but it's definitely something I'll remember for years ! :D Thanks though lt 3
A spoon , or maybe even an axe ! I'm not sure if you could use it for anything else though ...
I've heard lt 3rdl3r4nk
He's not even mad about it though ... he just wants to get his revenge on that kid who was trying to do something similar in front him ! :D D: lt 3
He's already been confirmed to appear as an enemy , so I doubt it'll happen anytime soon ... but who knows ? Maybe he could show up later on ! :D
Because it's not a spell . It is an ability , and abilities are spells too ! s
I'm not sure , but I think it's pronounced like'moo'or something along those lines ...
I'm sure they were able to get jobs elsewhere , but I don't think that's what happened here ...
They're touring again this year , so it's not like you can't see them in a few months time ! They've been on tour for about 10 15 of their career now ... lol :P Edit spelling error .. oopsie daisy D: lt 3
You should play both ! They're great games for different reasons :D
I've seen it mentioned on here a few times , but I don't think anyone's really been able to find any episodes or anything like that ... ?
I'm a big fan of his as well ! He's just so ... different from most other leaders in Canada ?
I think he's just trying out his new position . He'll be back after half time and will probably get some snaps with that squad again next week ! s
I'm sorry to hear that !
I think you mean goal diff , not differential ... but yeah that's a good point too !
He was in front of kimi for a while , but he got caught up and lost position by him getting out on track again so quickly ...
It's not about winning , it's about sending a message .
I'm sure they'll be fine ... just like last year ! s Edit : I was wrong about that one guys .. it's not happening this time around lolololllllzzzs
I think he means the word swap .
I hope so . I want him and the rest of them in a fight for that last spot on the podium !
I think the movie was pretty good . I thought that they did an excellent job with making sure you didn't have to watch any more than one scene at a time ! :D edit spelling error ..
It was just an example ... I'm sure there are many more like these out there !
I'm not a rapper , but if you want to be one ...
I was about to say ... my friend's dad is a little taller but he looks like an inch or two taller in person !
I think it was a different teacher . I don't recall that one either , but maybe you can find something online about it !
I think it looks like he has some kind o'grudge against his brother or something ... I don't know why though :P
It's not that bad ... but you're right , it is scary !
I don't think so . I've never seen that before in my life but if there is an option to do this then yes !
I feel better now , but not as much ...
I'm not sure what you mean by that ... but yes they all share a border with us so it makes them north american countries ?
Nope . They're still going to be on the show tonight and tomorrow night though !
I think they're just trying not to make it look like she's in trouble , but I could see how that might have been a problem for some people ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic but it's a good one !
Jimmies were rustled when he was casted for the role of Joffrey , and I'm sure they're still riled up about it now ...
I think he's going to be the next big thing for WWE after Cena retires and they have a new guy who can take over as champ at WM30 ! s
I'm not sure if I should be laughing or crying .
It's not . It just makes a lot of sense in this context , and is an easy way around having all these movies have their own rating system .
He's a good guy , but I don't think it was intentional to be honest ...
Or maybe both ? I'm not sure , but it's possible that the two are mutually exclusive and one is a symptom of another ... or something like this ! :D D: lt 3
I'm not sure if this is a joke or serious . I hope it's both , because that would make me laugh out loud for realz ! :D
I'm sure it is a lot more than that ... but still not enough to make me want to watch the show ! :P
I'm not sure what the problem is but it's a good idea to try and find out if they fit right or not ! Thanks anyway though :D lt 3
I'm not sure , but I think it's because of the fact that they're in different regions and are using different servers for their business .
It's a deck that can be played on turn one . It doesn t need any help from other players or anything like it does with standard decks and formats ...
I think it's a good thing that they didn't have to do anything with her story arc at all ... I mean she wasn t even there ! s
I'm American and have never heard of him ... what's he like ? Is it the same as Donald trump or something else entirely ..
I'm sorry to hear that !
He's not bad . He has some issues but he is definitely above the rest of our roster and I think it will be more than enough to win games this year ... maybe ! s Edit : spelling error fixed lolololooololllllooooooowwwwwwooooshhhahahahaahhhaaawwaaaahhhhhhhhheeeeeeelloooooooooohhhhhhuhuuhuuughaaaaaaaalrightyayyyeeehuehuuhuaahhhauuh
I'm not sure what you're trying to say . I think it's pretty clear , though : The Moon shines when there is a full moon and no one else can see anything .
I would say it's a bit easier to get into , but I'm not sure how much .
I'm 27 , too ! And 3 years in the Navy ...
It's like that scene from The Big Lebowski , except with more money !
I'm sure he was just trying out for his next job , but yeah this is pretty bad .
It is , and the movie was made in house .
I think it's one if his best matches , but that was a great match too !
I'm not sure if I should support Brazil or Germany ... but either way we will have a good time ! :D
I think the costumes were great , but they didn't really do much to make me want to see more of them in general ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I'll take it either way !
I think it's only 3rd and 1 , not sure though ... I'm pretty new to football so don t know all the rules of this game yet lol ! Thanks for letting me know tho ' :D lt 333333 3333 3333 3434353 2 0
I'm not sure if that's true , but I've heard this before and have seen some people say they could get away with just renting out their house to someone else ! ? :P Edit spelling error .. lolololoolloli
You're welcome ! I'm glad you liked it . :D
I am the walrus !
It's okay to cry when you're a woman ?
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll . Either way I laughed at this one !
Same here , it's a shame because that game looks amazing ! But yeah ... It does get pretty bad at times :P
I don't know , man ... He's got that one thing going for him : The ability not to be injured in practice and play football at all times ! s
I think it's a bot . It just posts the same thing over and over again with no context or explanation of what happened in this case ...
Brock's not even close in terms of strength though ... he has a lot less muscle mass compared with the other guys on that list but still pretty impressive for his age imo ! :P edit spelling error lolololoolllllooooooowwwwwwoooohhhahahaahahhhaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhheeeeeeelloooooooooooooooooooooooooolOLO
I think he means the voice line for'Full MUTE All'was removed from the game because of how annoying it can be when your team doesn't want a mic anymore ... :P Edit spelling ! D: lt 3
I'm not Dutch , but I do know that the Netherlands has a lot of lakes . They're just too big to be considered freshwater in this context ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... I hope it was sarcasm , because that is a pretty good analogy for how things are going in China right now .. lol ! :D D: lt 3
It was a good movie but I think it had too many plot holes and not enough characters to be considered canon anymore IMO ...
It's like a wet , smelly , mold . I'm not sure if that is good or bad ... but it smells awful and tastes horrible !
This is how I learned about it too ...
I'd say he's a little more accurate than Cutler , but not by much and his throws are wayyyy less consistent compared to the other QBs in this draft class ...
I'm going to be a hero ! I'll save this world from devastation , and then die for it ...
It's a great feeling ! I hope you're doing well , and that it gets better for your family soon lt 3 hugs
Webb is a great character , but I think he's too much of an overused trope to fit into this world .
It is probably just some sorta cargo . I think they are going to be used for transporting people and stuff like this .
It's just an option for people who are interested and have the time or money to do it themselves without having to pay out of pocket ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll ... but this sounds like something from an episode in Futurama !
I thought that was a little weird too . I think they're trying to make him look like a young Vince McMahon , but with less hair and more muscles !
I'm hoping for a new IP . I want more of this type stuff in my games , not just generic shooters with guns and explosions that are fun but boring at times ... :P !
It's not that bad if you have multiple accounts and vote for more than one person at once ... I think this is an excellent solution ! :D Thanks ! u dogetipbot 10 Doge verify
TCU is a football school . They don't count as an FBS team because they're technically still considered part of the conference , but I think that's what he meant by Big XII ... sorry ! :P Edit : typo error fixed it up lolololoollooooloooowwwwwwoooooohhh oopsie daisy dukes
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but I think it's pretty clear that he is joking about this whole thing and just wanted to make fun of us for being silly :P Edit : grammar correction fixed stuffs
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I don't think it's a huge problem for me personally because my mortgage isn t even close to being worth anything in comparison with mine ... ? ! s Edit : grammar
I think it's just fantasy ... but I'm not complaining !
He's got a pretty big head . I think he looks like an elf , but that might be just my imagination though ! :P He is definitely taller than most of us would expect him to be .. lololollolooolooohhhahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhhhhhhheeeeeeheeaaaaaaaagh
I've never had a bad one ! It's just not my favorite flavor to drink out of .
I'm not seeing it ... I think you're looking for a different subreddit ? r misleadingthumbnails maybe .. or something like that :P Edit : Nevermind found it and subscribed to this sub lolololloloopsie
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll ... but I laughed anyway :D
I'm with you on this one , but only because they're all so good !
That's what the bathroom break was for !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but I think that's what happened to us last year ...
I think that's what they're calling them now , but I'm not sure if there is any official name for this new thing yet ...
I'm not sure what the point of this post is . It's just a joke about how much money people have to spend on skins ... ?
I live near Chicago and have always called them maize bagging or something like this ... but now you mention it seems more common here than anywhere else ! Thanks for sharing your experience with me :D lt mfw
He's not even that bad ...
You donut know me ! I'm the one who knocks ...
I think it is more of Fnatic being outplayed by their own team than anything else ... but I agree on this one ! They were just too good at MSI :D Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolz xdxdxddxxlulzzzsss XDXDDZ XDXD
I was thinking it looked more like the ice cube from Frozen ... but I guess that's just me ! :D
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted for this ... It makes sense !
I agree , it's a bit of an odd design choice for sure ! But I think the idea behind this one was cool and unique enough not too much effort needed :P Thanks though man lt 3
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed of myself ...
Can i get a link too ? Thanks man :D DDDdddeep daaaaaaap ppppfffffft ...
I'm sure they'll be fine with him getting 2 more than Ronaldo did in his last two seasons at Madrid ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling . I don't think he's actually a fan of him , but that doesn t mean we can't make fun outta this guy ! :D lt 3 u bb
That's awesome ! I'm sure she'll be happy to hear that from you :D She looks like such an amazing girl lt 3
I think she's a bit more concerned with the fact that he didn't get her number , but rather got her phone and texts from someone else ...
I'm not saying you should , just pointing out how unethical and immoral your idea is in general ...
I'm 16 , but I'll keep that in mind ! Thanks :D
I think it's more likely they're trying out for the FBI , and Flynn is a part of their team now so I'm sure there are some connections between them as well ... ? ! s Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolz
A computer simulation , if you will ...
I think he's doing a good job of it , but I wouldn t say they are laundering anything . They re paying him for his services and not because of some phony contract dispute or something .. lol ! srsly tho :P edit : spelling error fixd up there xD hahaahahaahahhaa hahahahaaaahhhheeeehee
He's not even in the game . He was just added to Smash 4 , and he wasn't even playable at all until recently ...
I'm 40 , my dad is 44 ...
I think so . I don't know if they're playing today though , but it's not like there are no other teams left to play for either of them ... right guys .. ? Right ! s :P Edit : spelling error fixed that one up lolololoolloli oopsie daisy dukes
I'm not sure if you are being serious or sarcastic but I think it's funny either way ! :D
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that you're right ... but it is the Browns , so there will probably still be some browns fans in this sub ! :D lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling but I think the difference in performance from both regions was pretty much even last year with TSM being better than CLG IMO ... ? ! s
I do , but only when it's a good idea to play with my right hand on the controller and not in front of me ...
I don't know , but I'm sure it'll be a lot better than what we have now .
I think it's more like they were trying not to fall asleep and then accidentally fell into her trap ... I mean what kind if monster would do such an evil thing ? ! s
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling . But I'll take your word for it and say that the town is in fact called Bielfeld .
I'm not sure , maybe it's because they're so hot that people want to see them in public and show off how much better looking they are than everyone else ... idk lolololllll :D DDDdddeephhhhhahahahaha XD xoxoOOooOoooXxooooooooooooooooOOOO ltsss
I think he's just trying not get his head cut off by a guy who is 6 feet tall and has been in NBA for years lol ...
I think you're right , and the fact that he didn't even say anything to his wife makes me believe this isn t him at all ...
Or wear one of those helmets that are designed to protect your head from being hit by an impact . Kids can't be expected not to get hurt when they're playing football ! s
Bayern is a very lucky club , they've won every single CL since 2004 and are currently on top of their group with PSG as well ! s
I'm sure you'll be able too ! I've been saving money since the beginning of this year and it's only going down from here on out :D

Then it's not Russia anymore ...
I've been playing since launch and have gotten 2 or 3 in a row , but they're all from loot boxes ... so no worries there ! :D
I'm not even mad , that's amazing !
I think that's the point , to make them feel bad about themselves and not be able too much more than what you can do for yourself in life without being successful ! :D DDDd ... wait .. wrong sub ? lolololllzzzzzzzZZZs
Saudi Arabia because I'm a fan of the country .
I've been there for years now ... it gets easier !
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad .
It's a joke , I think ? It was just an example of how the game works and why you should never do that in ranked games ...
I think that may be why he didn t get into soccer as much after college and then went back on track in high school ... maybe ? idk lol ! :D edit .. lt 3lzzzgjhfw8r4m7s1e5d3n2b9y0x
I'm sure they do , I just don t think that s what the people want to hear from them though ...
I don t know what to say ...
I'm not sure if that was intentional or just an accident , but I laughed anyway ! Thanks for watching and giving me some laughs today :D lt 3
He's not calling the fouls . He just doesn't want to give a yellow card for something that wasn t even a penalty ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that it was a good game , but at least we got some entertainment out of it ! :D
Richters moveset has been changed , but he still uses his old one for most things now so it doesn't really matter anymore imo :P But yeah they're both pretty similar !
You're in luck , it's a great game ! I've played through them all and they are fantastic games with lots of replayability if you have any interest at all ...
I'm American and I've never heard of this before ...
I'm sure it will be back , but you'll need to wait until the next event comes around ! :D
I'm not sure if I want to , but it's definitely on my list of things that are going through my mind right now ...
Same here . I'm not sure why , but it just felt right to me ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious , but it's because of the way that cars are designed and how they handle differently than other countries'vehicles ...
Because you're a drummer ? I'm not sure what else to tell ya ...
I'm a big fan of bears , but they're not my favorite animal ! They are so cute though : 3
I got a 5 star Ninian and a 4 star Ninio ... I'm not even mad lol !
I'm sure you're right , but I just don't want him getting too worked up over a little thing like that ! Thanks for the input though :D lt 3
That would be pretty cool if they were , but I don t think so ... :P Maybe we should try and get some footage !
Because they're both pretty good characters with great potentials in the game . I'm not sure what you mean by hate though ...
I think so . They're a good team and they've been playing well lately but I don't see them beating anyone else this year besides UVA or UNCG IMO ... maybe Wake Forest though ! :P Edit spelling error lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwww
I think he's playing a different guy . He was on that show for like 3 episodes , but they cut him out of it because his acting wasn't good enough anymore ... ? ! s Edit : spelling error correction ..
I'm sorry . I'll try to find a better one next time ! Thanks for letting me know though :D
I think they were just showing off how much of a flashback he had , not really anything more than an explanation for why his character is there in the first place ...
It's not you , but I think that is what he meant when saying'accidental fouls are no longer allowed in football ... '
He s already at 26.5 with 2 games left to play ! He has no reason not too get better every game now though ... I m sure it'll happen eventually lolololllll ..
I think you mean BAMA TE's . They are pretty decent , but not as good at football like Alabama WRs or LSU DBs ...
I'm in Sweden and it's been freezing for weeks now , I think we're due another one soon !
Thanks for the report ! We'll look into this issue as soon we can , but if you're still having issues please let us know so that we can help out more quickly :D Thanks again !
The one with a bunch of people in suits . It's called The Big Lebowski .
It is if it violates the terms and conditions for your job .
You're gonna be disappointed if you don't hear it , but that's okay ! It'll happen eventually anyway ... right ? Right guys .. ? Guys ?
I'm pretty sure it's Mohammed Bin Salaam .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote ...
I'm a sales rep , but I work at the store that sells them and have to deal with customers who don't know what they're doing ...
They did , and it was a good one too !
I'm not sure what that has to do with anything I said ... ?
I'm sure it's a common thing in the US , but I've never heard of anyone teaching that before here either !
I'm sorry to hear that , man ... I hope you can find a way out soon !
I thought it was a play on words for'poor people's car ' ... I'm not sure though ..
I've had that happen to me before too but it's not nearly as bad now because of how often you can use your jump key for jumpscares etc .. :P
I'm glad to help ! :D
I think that's what we're trying for , but I'm not sure how well this will work out in practice ...
I'm a dad and I approve of that comment !
I think so . I'm not sure though because the light was on for a while and then off again when i went to sleep lol ! Thanks tho :D D: lt 3
gl with your life ! :D
It's both in the show and comics . It was a bit more obvious when they were talking about it on Arrow last week though ...
Because the game is still in early access and there's no reason for them not be able too do something about that right now ... Right guys ! Guys .. ? s
It's a good thing you're not writing code , then ... :P I hope it helps with your app too though and if there is any bugs or issues let me know ? Thanks again ! lt 3
I think it's just the way he looks at you , but I could be wrong ! He is very friendly and loving though so maybe not all dogs are like this ... lol :P hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhheeeeheeaaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhhh
He didn't jump , he slid down and then fell over backwards into his own path to get out of bounds before getting back in stride for another play ... ? That's not jumping lol ! srsly ..
I think you're onto something here ... I'm gonna go ahead and say yes to all of those things !
I was sleeping . He's a good boy ! :D
I'm doing well , how about yourself ? :D I've been up all night so far but it's still early in the day for me lol ...
I'm not sure if you've ever had brussel sprouts but they taste amazing ! I love them with some lemon juice or lime to spice it up too :D
I think it's because he got his Halloween costume from last year . He just wanted to make sure everyone knew that they were getting their costumes this time around ! :D lt 3
Because it's a good item . It was always going to be good on him , and he already had the best base stats in game for his kit anyway ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but I think it's a joke ...
I think that's what the character says when you select them in Smash 4 . I'm not sure though ...
He was the best player on our team last year , and we were in the playoffs ... I think it is pretty clear his value has gone up since then .. ? ! s Edit : spelling error fixed lolololoolllll
I think it's more about the fact that he was asked to do this , and they didn't want him doing anything else ...
I'm going for the draw . I think it's a good idea , but not sure if they'll do that or not ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling but Varus is a melee champion and has no ranged abilities ... so he's basically an assassin with his ulti ? :P Edit : spelling error fixed it ! xD
Go for it , you can't drink all day if your not drinking !
He's a great blocker and has some speed . He could be an upgrade over our current RB situation if we can get him on board with us in free agency next year ... maybe ! :D Edit spelling error .. lolololoolloliogloooooowwwwwwooohhhahahaahahhahahaaaahhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaawwweeeeeeelllloooowwwewooooooooaalrightyayyyeeehuhuheuuughuehuehuh
I think you mean revelations , but yeah it's a great game !
I'm not sure , but they're still there in my head ! :D Thanks though ...
I'm sure it was a very peaceful and quiet funeral , but I don't think the family would have been happy with that outcome either ...
I'm glad you're getting the hang of things !
I'm going ! I've been wanting this for so long .
I think you mean mammoth ?
It's not like they're going to have the same stats as their melee weapons , but I agree that this is an awesome idea ! :D
I've had this happen , but it was an automated response from my manager so I don't know if they actually do anything with emails anymore ... ?
I'm not really a fan of the game but it's still fun so why wouldn't i ? :D Thanks anyway though man ill probably get that too haha thanks again lt 3
Rng has been playing better lately . KT just got a new coach and they are looking to improve their roster as well ! I think it's safe for them too :D Edit spelling ...
I'd say it's likely that they'll be in the same spot as last year . I'm not sure how much of an impact this will have on their ranking though ...
He's a good guy , but I think that was more of an act than anything else ...
I'm pretty sure that's what happened in the movie ...
I'm from the same area ! I've been to the mountains and rivers in this state before but never seen anything like it ... looks awesome though :D thanks for sharing OP lt 3
You'd be surprised how many people are willing and able , but don't want to risk it for the sake of their own safety or well being ...
ZAPDOS is gone , sorry ! I'll update the list now though so you can get one of them back :D
Forest . I like the mountains and forests are more fun to explore , but it's not as much of an adventure if there is no one around ! :D
It's a great show . It has some flaws , but overall is very enjoyable and well made for the most part !
I think it would have been a better outcome for both teams if they had played in Atlanta instead ... but I guess we'll never know now ! :P Edit : Spelling is hard sometimes lolololoolllll
I've seen them in my time there too ! They're so cute and they have such great personalities :D
I'd rather have him play Batman than Superman or Wonder Woman ... I don't think he's the right fit for either one though ..
I've done both of those things . It was worth every penny !
You can't see anything , but you still have your senses and hearing ...
I'm glad you enjoyed ! It's not often that someone can pull off something like this , but when they do ... well .. wow :D Thanks for watching and commenting on my video ! lt 3
Because it's the offseason .
You don't . It's just an illusion of choice , like how people can choose to eat or not eat certain foods and still be healthy ! s
I think you guys are going for the record . I'm not sure though ...
I think he looks better in the new movie than he did when I saw him as Wolverine and X Men Origins : Apocalypse . He s definitely aged well though ...
You're right , I'm not going anywhere anytime soon ! Thanks though man :D
He was in a different weight class , so that would have been an easy fight for him to win at least one more time ...
I'm so excited to see him as a villain ! I hope he gets more screen time this season too ...
They're not invading , they are just trying out their new military strategy of'don't let them get away with anything ! '
It's been like that for a while . It was the first time I noticed it , and now its every other day or two since then ...
It's a great match but I think the crowd would have been more into that if they were chanting for Ortons theme song instead of Roddy Piper or something like that ... ? ! s Edit : spelling error fixed lolololooolooollllloooooowwwwwwoooohhh my godddd
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is a thing now ...
It isn t but the media will still spin anything into a drug war against him and his family because they are in power now ...
Yeah I agree with you there ! But it s still not like we are playing against one of our best teams or something ... :P Edit spelling
I am available right now ! Let's do this :D Adding and coming on plaza in a few minutes , just send the trade request whenever u see my name pop up x3 Thanks again lt 3
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious but I think it was sarcasm and he meant for his car to be able't get wet in the rain ? Idk though lol ! :P hahaahahaahahhhaa .. haaaaahhhheeeeheeaaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhhh
Jesus was white , he wasn't black ...
I'm not sure what you're getting at , but it sounds like your comment is about the US military being too powerful to do anything without congressional approval ... which isn't true either way .. lol ! :P s
I'm enjoying it , but I think there's a lot of room for improvement on both sides ...
I don't think it's a problem , I just thought the idea was funny and wanted people who didn t have Facebook installed on their phone or something like this ... ? :P Sorry !
I'm sure he's a great guy , but I don't think that was his goal . He wanted him in front of the ball and not behind it like most defenders do ... ? ! s
I've been told that they're very nice people !
I'm hoping for a Gianni jersey with his face photoshopped onto it , but I doubt that will happen lol ...
Astronomy is a term used by astronomers to refer specifically to astrobiology . It's not really related at all , but it does have some similarities with astronomy and biology .
I'm with you , but I think it's a good bet to be honest !
I've never had a bad experience , but they're definitely overpriced and have terrible customer service if you ask me !
I'm pretty sure that was a gift from France to America after WW2 ... I don t know if you re right though but still ..
I think that's because of the fact they were a unified kingdom , not just an empire .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take it either way !
They're used for food .
I have the same problem with mine as well ... It's really annoying !
I'm not your buddy guy ! I don't have a friend who's like that either ... but if he is there for me to help him out with his problems .. well thanks man haha :D lt 3
I don't . I think he's a great guy and all , but the way his team is playing right now ... it just seems like they're not getting enough respect from him ! s
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of the fact that it's been used in an episode . Either way ... yes ! That was great too haha xD lt 3
I'm sorry for your loss !
I'd say so . You can get the same amount of content on PS4 as you could with XB1 if your budget is less than 100 dollars or more ! :D Edit spelling ...
I'm not sure what he's talking about . I've never had a problem with my bike locking up when it was locked down , but that might be because of me ... :P Edit spelling ! D: D DD
I'm sorry I didn't know that was a rule ! Thanks for the clarification though and good luck with your future posts :D
I'm not a fan of the beans in my tacos either but that's just me ...
Thanks ! I'm a big fan of Letterman's work so it was my first attempt at doing something like that haha :D Thanks for reading though !
He is pretty good as an action star though ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... I hope it was sarcasm though ! :D
I'm not sure what you're trying to say . Can someone explain ?
That would be a great idea ! I'll try and get some pictures up later today or tomorrow , if you're interested in that sort of thing ? :D Thanks for your interest though lt 3
What's the difference between them ?
What kind of stuff do they have ? I'm in a similar situation .
I think it's more like she got her own skin , and then gave up on that idea after getting another one ... I don't know though .. maybe they're just trying to make money ! :P lolololllll XD xDxDDdxdddeXDX D: lt 3
I think he's just upset that she didn t get a chance to talk with him after the game and then leave for work in an hour ? Idk though ...
I think you mean oop ?
I think it was just to show that you can't really do anything with your front brake without using both hands and feet at once ...
I think they're going to get a lot more money from us than we would . I'm not sure though , maybe it's because you guys have been so successful ? :P Edit : grammar
It's a great game , but I'm not sure if it'll be as good for me after the first few hours of playtime ...
I was thinking the same thing , but I think it's a lion cub ... so maybe not ? :P
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I think that's a pretty good comparison to the original film !
I'm from Germany and I've never seen a vest that wasn't on my car or bike ...
I think you mean that there's no way for us not be stuck with one timeline forever now ... but yeah , weird times have happened here and there too ! :D DDDddd daaaaaaaddddddddaaaaammmmmmmmmmnnnsss
You can't just say you're a fan of the team without mentioning their name , right ? That's how it works here ...
I think it was more of an homage to how he used his powers for evil and not just because he wanted to be Spider Man again ... but I could see your point ! :P lolololoolllll XD xD lt 3
I think he's too busy with The Revenant and the new Star Wars movie to do anything else right now ...
I'm glad you're not afraid . I was worried for a second there ...
I m not saying they are going down but I d rather have them play at home than on the road against us in primetime like this game is ...
I think that was mostly due to the fact that they were trying out for the Avengers and didn't want to be attached with another Marvel film at all ... ? I dunno , maybe .. shrugs :P Edit : words ! lolololoolllllzzzzzzzZZZZ Zzz zuizi
They did , but they were not the official sponsors of the team and weren't allowed to use their name in any way whatsoever until recently when they changed sponsorship with Audi .
I'm sure they'll be fine ...
I think it would be easier to just make one and harvest the seeds , but that's not really my style either ... :P But yeah ! That'd work too haha XD xD lt 3 u bbzkitties 2u2x3r4l
I think it's more likely that you'll be able join your friends'games and play together in co op mode or something similar if not just online .
Thanks ! I love it , she's my pride of the house :D She is so sweet too haha ...
Mine did not either ! I was so confused when they told me to call 911 and then nothing happened ...
I'm not even sure what that means , so it's okay !
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this made me laugh out loud at work ...
I'm a huge fan of the band The Killers . I've been listening since they were in high school and have listened every single album for years now ! They're amazing live too :D lt 3
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is a thing now ..
He's not even that good tbh ... He is just an average player who has been playing for years and still gets injured every now and then ..
I love that scene , but not as much as the rest of them ! It's just so ... perfect and beautiful to watch .
I'm not sure , but I think it's a good idea to keep the thread going . It'll be interesting if there is any discussion about this topic in future threads ! :D Thanks for your input though ... u dogetipbot 10 verify
They're not real . They just exist on this planet and we don't know how many of them there actually is or what their natural habitat looks like yet ...
I am the Senate !
It's not like he had to play with the best players in NA , just because they're from EU doesn't mean that their skill level is better than NA or KR ... ? ! s
I'll try to get better at this ! Thanks for your help man :D
A tiny , delicious little thing .
That's what I was thinking , but it sounded like he didn't want anyone else calling him about that particular issue and just wanted someone who could help with something specific ! Thanks for your input though :D lt 3
He was a liability on defense too , but I think that is more to do with his lack of experience than anything else ... He has been playing well though !
I was born in 1993 . I'm not sure what you're talking about , but it's still a long time ago for me to be alive and have kids . :P Edit : typo error on my part lolololllz ..
I like it because the map is huge and there's a lot to do in that area so you can easily get into fights with your team mates without being overwhelmed by mobs ! :D D: lt 3
I think she was just being sarcastic , but yeah it would be a bit of an awkward situation for sure lol !
I'm not sure if that's a good idea or bad ... but thanks for the advice ! :D
I don't think you're alone , but I'm also a big fan ! It's just so much fun to play with friends or strangers online :D
He's a bit of an overrated comedian , but his stand up is pretty good imo ...
You're right , I should have said that it's not a good look for them to be honest ! But still .. It is pretty creepy and disturbing at times :P Thanks though lololollolooseface.jpg XD xD lt 3
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take it as a compliment .
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but I laughed pretty hard at this one ! Have an upvote for your effort though :D lt 3
It's an old glass bottle . I think it was from when they were still selling them at the store , but not sure exactly what year or where ...
It's the way they sit on your lap , not you sitting down in it ... I think ? It looks weird to me too though ! :P
Braum has been around for years , he's just not as popular anymore because of his ult nerf and how much people hate him now that they're getting hit by it too often ... ? :P
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . Either way , it's a good one ! :D
I think you mean 1 5 ?
Because they're the ones who are supposed to be teaching .
Nah he's just going to build the wall and make them pay for it . s
He could have measured it , but didn t want anyone else seeing him do that and then taking his picture with a camera phone or something like this .. lol !
He was always like that though ... He just got more popular with his fans after winning the World Cup .
I think it's because the cans are too big and heavy for their weight class .
I'm moving from Austin next week ! Where are you headed ?
I think they will be able to do better than tsm but not sure about beating cw tho ... maybe if we get a good team like dig or clg ? :D ! D: lt 3333
I thought he was wearing a t shirt with no sleeves and had some sort of belt or something ? I could see how they might look shopped though ...
I'm not sure , but I think it's possible . It would be nice if there was some kindof option for that though ...
I think it might have just had to do with the fact they were in different states . I know there are plenty of Blood Drive events around here , though ! :D
Because they're ranked in a different poll .
I'm not sure . I think we're still a little nervous about our game against them though ...
I member ! Member Chewbacca again , I'memba .
They're good if you like a burger with your fries though ...
Yes , but they have a draw . So if the other team scores in stoppage it's still possible for them not to advance on away goals and vice versa ...
I'm not your City Boy , Buddy !
I think it was a joke . I'm not sure though , but that would have been my guess as well !
I think it's more that they're trying not get called for something , but still getting fouled on purpose so you can't do anything else . It happens all too often though ... lol ! :P Edit spelling error ..
Why are you here ?
I'm not saying that , I was just pointing out the fact .
You know what ? You can't be serious ...
He was a good kid . He had to go through some stuff , but he got over it and became an amazing father figure for his son .
I'm fairly certain I could swim in water if it was cold enough ...
He's not a good driver , but I think that is what they are trying to do with this one ...
I'm sure you could find some in a dumpster somewhere ...
I feel you , man ... hugs ! lt 3
He's got some serious heart , he was in my top 10 for sure ! He has been training with Roy Nelson since they were both at Bellator together so that helps too haha ... lol .. hahaha :D lt 3
He's the best player in NA right now . He is not even close to being top 3 ADC players on his team though ...
I'm glad we didn't have to play this game ! I was worried for a second there ...
I'm still bitter about that game , but it's not like we were playing them at home or anything ...
I think they're a top 10 team , but I don't see them beating anyone in that range or even close to being ranked at all this year ...
I've never seen egg cartons at my local grocery store here ... I'm not sure if that's normal or just an American thing ? !
I think they're still pretty popular for a lot more than just kids but yeah it's definitely not as big or expensive as you'd expect .
You can't buy an airplane with money you don t earn from it ...
I think it's a bit too much for some people , but I'm not sure why that would be an issue to you ?
I've done this before ... I'm not sure if it was a good idea or bad one though .. :D
That's what I'm doing now , but my reflection is so far away that you can't see me ...
I think it's gonna go like this : 1 . Caps 2 . Caps 3 . Caps 4 . Caps 5 . Caps 6 . Caps 7 . Caps 8.Caps 9 . Caps 10 . Caps 11 . Caps 12 . Caps 13 . Caps 14 . Caps 15 . Caps 16 . Caps 17 . Caps 18 . Caps 19 !
It's not a matter if you're Muslim or Christian , but how much money they have to spend on their religion is pretty important for them as well ...
Because he's hungry .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think that's a pretty good way to describe it ...
I'm hoping for a Wii U port of Super Mario RPG , but I doubt it'll happen anytime soon ...
Happy Birthday ! :D I'm sure you'll have a great time at the wedding too if it's your first one ever and not some other kind of party or something ... lol jk lt 3333
I'm sure she'll be fine . I've been there before with a friend who's from the Bay Area so we're all used up on that stuff by now ... but yeah .. good luck ! :D hugs
I'm not sure what that means but okay ! Thanks for letting me know :D
I'm not sure if I should be offended by this comment ... Or just amused that someone would say such things about my post ? Haha ! Thanks for clearing it up though :D lt 3
I'm sure you were a good sport about it , though !
I'm not sure if I should be proud that we won . But it's still an achievement for me and my friends to have done this on our own time haha xD Thanks again though lt 3
I think he's the best player in football today , and I'm not even a Liverpool fan !
I'm sure the penny is still warm from all of those years in the oven !
I got one from my first pack , but I don t think it s possible anymore since they removed them all together with the new icons system ...
I'm sure it's possible but I don t know how likely is this scenario ...
I'm still waiting for the day he gets a cameo on Arrow or something like that ...
I think he's just being sarcastic , but I could be wrong ...
It's not like you can see the flames . It just looks cool to me ! :D I'm sure there are other reasons too though ...
I think it's more likely they'll draw . They're playing a much better team than England , but still not good enough for them yet imo ...
I agree , but I think it's still pretty funny and relevant to this sub at least for now ... until we get more people who are actually interested in reading about them ! :D D: lt 3 u bbzkitties
I do , but it's not a mandatory thing for me to get vaccinated because of my job and family health issues ... so that s why they are asking about it ! :P lolololloloooloo
I think he's going to appear at some point during the movie but I don't know when exactly ... maybe after the credits ?
Up voted u too . Please return the favor and vote me back . Thanks in advance .
I think they're going to end with a big reveal at some point in season 2 or 3 and then it'll just continue from there for good measure ... I hope ! :D lt 3
I'd say the first one . The second one I'm not sure about but it's definitely a toss up between them for me personally !
Yes you are right now they have won 2 games against us but lost 1 game to them at home on a PP goal by our goalie ...
I think so . I've seen a few people do this at bus stops but not all that often ...
I think it was more of an observation on how much younger they are , but yeah you're right about the age difference lol !
FSU has been pretty solid . They're just not playing well on defense , but they've had some really nice plays and are getting better at it each week !
r NBA is a great sub but they don't have enough subscribers to make up for that lack of content in r NFL or MLB ... yet !
It's not . It just makes it easier for the US government and corporations to sell us out of our rights , which they have been doing since before we were born ! s
I'm not a bot , I just like to help people find things they can't remember about their childhoods and such ...
He's been banned in the past , but he was picked by someone else and then they got rid of him for some reason ... so it might be that one time ! :P Edit spelling error fixed lolololoolllll
I think it was a good call , but I don't know if he would've made that kick had they not taken time off for injury or something like this ... ? ! lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwwwahhhahahahaohhhhhhhaaaaahhhhheeeeeeheeaaaaaawwaaaattttuuuuhhhhhh haHAAHAAH HAHAAHH
I'm glad I wasn't alone in thinking it was weird . It's a very strange feeling !
It's a good thing we have the world's largest reserves of natural gas .
I'm sure they're all in London , but I don't think it would be a good idea to have them on your team if you were going for an English player ... ? ! s Edit : grammar
I think he's just wearing his glasses .
me three !
I'm glad you got them ! I hope they get their cars back soon , if not sooner than later ...
Same here , but it was for my first year of AmEx .
Warren . He has a better chance of winning the general election than Trump does at least if he wins his primary and then runs again after that ...
I think it's actually Sam from The Walking Dead , but I could be wrong ! Edit : spelling is hard sometimes ...
It's great ! I've played through the whole game and still haven't beaten all bosses yet but that is because they are so hard lol ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling . I hope it's the former though !
I think it's more of an issue with the way she looks than anything else , but I agree ! She is definitely my favorite character in this show so far ...
He's not reformed , but I think that was more of an act . He has been very vocal about wanting out and being happy with where things are headed for him now though ... ? ! lolololoolllll .. :D lt 3
He's been throwing a lot better lately I think it was just the wind at first though ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll but the last one is definitely true ...
I think you're right , but I'm not sure about that ...
I think so . I'm not sure though because there are a lot more songs than just this one and they're usually pretty good too !
I'm sure you could find a way , just look for the ones that are already there and make them yourself ! :D
I woke up at 4:30 am . I was so tired that day , but still had plenty time for the rest !
I've read it , and loved it ! It's a great series of books that really gets you into the world .
He's not that bad , he just has no personality and is always trying too hard for attention or something like that ...
I have an Ikea drill that is pretty much the same as this but with more holes in it ! It's called a holebuster or something like that ...
I think we've had enough of those .
I've never had a problem with my phone , but I have no idea what kind of moisture the screen has on there ...
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've seen a lot of people use this on their bikes and they seem fine ...
I'm not sure if you're serious , but he's actually a pretty good actor . He was in The Big Lebowski and is also great on Parks amp Rec !
I'm not sure . I think it's more about how much we're losing and our defense is playing well , but that could change in the second half ...
I'm not . It's a great tune ! I just thought it sounded like something out of an 80s movie or TV show , which is why i posted this here ...
It was a joke , I'm sure you're not the only one who thought that ! :D
I thought it might be a reference to the movie The Big Short ... but then again , there are no banks in the big short so who knows ? :P Edit spelling ! Thanks for pointing out my error lolololoolllllzzzzzzzZZZLooooooOoOOoooohhhHhahahahaha XD
He's been playing great , but he has a lot of room to improve on his shooting form and footwork . He needs more time in the gym though !
I'm sure they'll be fine with a few million dollars in damages and some legal fees ... but I doubt it will happen any time soon .. lol ! :D D: lt 3
I have a few of these , and love them ! They're super warm too so you can wear it in the summer without worrying about heat stroke or anything like that :D
I'm from Texas and we have a lot more variety than the rest . I've had some good stuff here , but it's not as much fun to eat there ! :P lololollolo
I was thinking the same thing ! She's so happy and excited about it all , I love her reaction to that part of the video :D
He's also played at striker for years now and has scored more league goal than messi ever did ...
I'm going for the same thing , but I'll be using my car instead of an RV !
That'd be too easy though ... I mean it could work but you're right about not being able do much with them at this point in time :P Thanks for your input ! lt 3
I agree with this 100 percent ! I think the only thing that's changed is their sizing options now ... which makes me sad because it was so good before .. lol :P lt 3
I'm not sure if this was sarcasm or not , but it's true for most people in their mid 20s who have no idea how much they can make off drugs ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll ... but I'll take your word for it and upvote anyway ! :D
I have a pair on my phone already ! It's so much better than touch id .
I would have to agree with you on this one , but the voltage is still a bit high for me ...
It's a lot better than the first one , but not by much and definitely worth playing if you're into that kind of thing ! It was my favorite game last gen ...
I'm sure he's a good person and all but I don t think it s fair for him or anyone else who is in his position to be so disrespectful towards customers ... ? ! lol jk lt 3 u bbz 2x3
It's on NBC Sports Network , so you can stream it online if your cable provider has that channel !
I think it looks like the cat is trying to eat him , but he just can't get enough of his food and decides not too ! :D lt 3
That's a good idea , but it would be hard to get them back if they were all in Saskatoon and not Regina or Moose Jaw ...
Mithy is not even close . He's the best mid in NA , and he was on that CLG roster for like 2 years before they got relegated ...
I think he'd be fine with it being the same as his old one ... but I'm not sure about this new one ..
You're not the only one , my friend !
I'm not sure what the difference between playing in handheld mode and full screen would be but that sounds like an interesting idea ! Thanks for your input :D Edit : spelling error fixed ... lolololoollooooloooooohhh ..
I think the point is that they're not going anywhere and are still a good team with some potential for growth in the future ... which I'm fine with ! :D lt 3
I was thinking the same thing , but I think it's just a reflection of how much time passed between shots and that part is still in focus ? Idk ...
Stats are the only thing that matters , but I agree with you 100 about stats being a big factor for MVP voting this year ...
RemindMe ! 2 years
I'd be okay with that , but I don't think he's worth a max contract right now ...
I'm not sure what you mean by this but it's funny because the original Paladin class was called The Priest Class and they were considered Paladins in WoW ...
I'm sure you're not the only one who feels that way , but I think it's pretty cool !
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've been playing through both on my PS3 and they have cloud save capabilities in each game ...
You're hired ! Welcome to GameJunior !
I'm sure he's a lot more than just the most popular man in America . I mean , look at his hair ! It looks like it could be made from gold or something ...
I think he's just a little bit too busy with the other things to worry about that much anymore !
West Lake Village , LA
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but that's a pretty good comparison for what we've seen so far in this movie !
It's a great flavor ! I've been trying to find it in the states for years , but no luck yet :P
I'm not a spy . I am an adult and have been for years now ...
I'm sure it'll be back when the new runes come out ... I mean they're not going to nerf it any time soon ! s :P
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of the name ... but I think it's funny either way ! :D
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it was a joke ... ?
I'm sure you can find someone who will take care of your kids if they ever need help with anything , but yeah ... cry 0men would be pretty awesome ! :D
I think that's a good thing . It looks like he is trying to be edgy and not look too silly , but I guess you're right about his style choice :P Thanks for your feedback though lt 3
He's been shooting like he wants to be out of this league for years now , so no worries about that one shot at least !
I think you're right . It's just that the pictures are so cute and adorable , but they don't really fit with what we want to see in this sub :P Thanks again though lt 3
EA . I'm not even a big fan of the game and this is just awful ...
I'm not sure if I've ever seen a film with him as an actor who didn't make me laugh out loud at some point or another ... but yes ! That was hilarious too :D lt 3
He was the only one who could get a shot off , but he couldn't finish his shots either ...
It's a chow mein !
I'm glad you're sleeping ! Have fun at work tomorrow :D
You're a good man !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of me ... but that's actually pretty funny !
You're a good man . I'm sure you'll be fine !
It has been great , the only thing that could be better would have to come from a different angle on the show than what we've seen in previous years ...
He was a starter for us last year , so he can probably still play at that level of football if needed ... right guys .. Guys ! I'm not crazy here :D srsly though i think its stupid lolololllzzzzyyyywazzuupsss
He's not a good QB and he has no confidence in his arm strength or accuracy yet to be honest with you guys ... but that is the way we are playing right now ! lololollolooolooohhhahahaahahhahahaaaahhhhhhhh haaaaaaaaalllloooooowwwwww
I think it's a little bit of both . I'm not sure if they're going for Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul , but I like them all equally ! :D Edit : spelling ...
I'm in Canada , and I've never seen a single one for sale here that was less than 100 CAD ...
That's awesome ! Good luck with your new career path :D
Purdue is playing great , but OSU just looks better than they have in a while now that we're not getting blown out by them every week anymore ...
I'm not sure what your point is ? I don't think there's any story in the game where they're going on adventures or anything like that ...
I'm not even mad . That's amazing and hilarious at the same time ...
I'm sure you'll be fine , but it's not like he has a choice in this matter ...
I'm not going anywhere , but if you want me back ...
I don't think so because the ban message was just for me and not others who were also banned from this subreddit ... but maybe that's wrong :P Edit : spelling ! D: lt 3 u bbzkitties 2u2e4y3r5g8q7w6a9f1c0h xDxXdxdoxxxddxsdfghhhmmmmmmnnnnggglzzsssrsploZxcvbsn
I'm not sure what you're talking about , but I'll take it !
I've always heard that as well . I think the word is more along those lines , but both are good ! Thanks ! :D
If we get a TD , I'll be happy with that !
I'm surprised you didn't see the comments on this thread , it's pretty much all anti immigration sentiment in here atm ...
I think it's because they're all at the same range , and you can't see their health bars until after a certain distance away from each other .
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll . But he's definitely my favorite player in baseball right now and that would make me happy to see him go ! :D DDHahahaha ...
Because this is r Canada . We're all just as stupid here if you don't agree with our opinions or even think we should be better than them ! s
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this comment ...
The Rock from Pluto .
I'm not sure if you're being serious ... But the picture is from my office and we do get some really nice weather here ! :D Thanks for your comment though lt 3
I think it's more likely that one of those countries would be in the final than any other country ... but I'm not sure about that yet ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed now .. thanks u daniellehooleye for pointing this out lolololooolollllloooooowwwwwwoooohhhahahahaahaaaahhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaawwweeeelldddeeeeuuuuhhhhhhheehuehuehheewoooooooooo
I think it's just because they're wearing a lot of makeup and have long hair , but yeah that makes sense too !
That's what I thought too , but then they would have had a different title for the movie ...
They're already doing that . They just don't know how yet ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I hope so though !
That's what they say about me too ! Haha ... but it is true that you have no idea how much of an impact your presence has on people :P lolololllll
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic ... but it's a good thing that people are allowed their own opinions on this matter ! :D
Because it was a good story .
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack if this happens again ...
Groundhogs day was the first one , but it wasn't a remake of any other movies either ... so I don t think that counts as a sequel at all ! s Edit : typo error fixed for clarity ..
I'm sorry to hear that , but I hope you can find a way out of this !
It's on PC too , but I don't think it'll get much traction outside of that platform since the game was developed for PS3 and not 360 or XB1 . :P Edit spelling ! D: lt 3
I think the first one was pretty good and they're making a second one so maybe that's what you want out of them !
I'd be more worried about the Iron Giant's legs than his arms ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but it's actually just an old picture from when he was in Canada ...
I was going to ask if that is where they got their inspiration from . It looks amazing , and would be cool for them too have some of those rides back home ... lolololllll :D DDDdddeephhhhhahahaha XD x3 lt 3333
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but that's the best timeline !
I have one too . It's great for music and movies !
I'm not sure what I expected .
I think so , but I'm not sure . It's a pretty big update and they're probably going to add more stuff in later patches or something like that ... :P Edit spelling error fixed lolololoolllll
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I hope the latter is true though ! :D
I think it does 50 , but I'm not sure if the numbers are correct for all bears ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this .
I think it's more about the fact they're not going to release an Android version for their flagship phone , but rather one with a different OS and hardware design language ... ? ! s
It's a good thing you're not the one who has to explain it .
I think it's more that people don't want their car stolen .
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but I think that's actually pretty funny and clever ...
I think he was just going for that sweet , sweet karma ...
Modra is not that great , but his passing has been phenomenal this season so far for me to be honest ! He's definitely one of my favorite players right now :D Edit edit
I'm sure that's why they're all dating guys with shorter arms and legs ... to get around this problem ! s
Thanks for reminding me to read up on my manuals before buying one lol ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but it's a great show and the books are amazing too ! Go read them all at least once in your life :D D: lt 3
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry at this ...
I'm not even from Holland and I care . It's just that it is so much more important to me than other things in life ... like my country ! :D D: lt 3
I'm with you on that one ! It's a terrible movie and the soundtrack is awful too ... but at least they're trying to make something interesting for once in their lives .. ? :P lol jk lt 3
I think that's a good point . I'm not sure why you're being downvoted though ... it would be interesting to see !
I'm pretty sure he's talking about the fact they can't see him .
I'm sure there are plenty more people who have been murdered by their own hands than that many murders committed in one place ... but yeah , this was just an example :P Edit spelling error .. lol edit
I'm pretty sure that's only for those who have already reached Level 13 . I've seen it happen with some of my friends , though they were in their first class . :P Edit spelling ...
I'd be okay with that . I think he's a great fit in our system , but we need to get him on board ASAP before his value goes down drastically ! :P Edit spelling ...
I think it's a good thing though ! It makes her look like she has some sort of mental illness or something and I love seeing people with those faces :D lt 3
I haven't but I've heard good things about them !
I think it's the right way around , but I agree that they're not synced up well enough to be a good representation for what we see in game . :P Thanks !
He's not . He has a good car , but he doesn't have that great of an engine .
I'm not sure , but it's definitely possible that you are one of us ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but that's exactly what happened to my dad when he got a new car and had no idea where his key was ...
I'm not sure if you've heard , but there was an earthquake last week ! I think they were talking about how hot this weekend has been up here ?
I think you mean the Jaguars ?
Adblock Plus ?
He was born at least 12 years old . He's still pretty young for his age , but I think it makes sense that he'd be more of a child than adult character now ! :P Edit spelling error ..
I'm still not convinced .
The last game against Hull . I was so happy to see them go down , but then they went on a run and won it all !
I'm sorry for your loss ! :D I hope you get a good one soon and enjoy it as much as possible while playing with friends or something like that ... ? x3 lt 3
And there was a lot more than one touchdown .
I'm not sure if that's what I said , but yes ... That would make sense ! Thanks for clearing up my confusion :D
I'm not saying it's realistic , but there are plenty of ways for society to improve itself without resorting too much on drugs or alcohol ...
He's a bit of an awkward guy to be around sometimes but he does his job well enough that it doesn't bother me too much anymore haha ! Thanks for watching though :D lt 3333
I think you're right , but I'm not sure if that means they can't do a good job or just aren t as talented ?
I hope so . I want to see him hit one of those three pointers in the playoffs !
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think he's actually trying to make it look like an actual gameboy color instead of his own creation ... ?
He was just trying not too hard ...
I'm just saying that the game looks like a monster hunter world clone and they're both good games so why would you want to play them ? :P
It's not like it was a serious movie or anything ...
I think he was there for one of our games last season , but it wasn't during an actual game so no need to bring him up again haha ! :P Thanks though man lt 3
He is the best striker in MMA , and he has been for years now ... I don't think you need to remind us that much anymore ! :D
It's a Wii U game . So yes , it will be able to run GC titles on the switch ! :D
He's just happy he got it for Christmas ! He was so excited when I showed him this picture and said , ' you're welcome ! :D lt 3
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . Either way I laughed at this comment and upvoted it for the sheer absurdity of your username ...
Horizon is a great game , but I think the story of that one was pretty weak compared to other games in its genre ...
It's a Tuesday night game , and they're playing in Miami . It'll be packed on Thursday too !
I think it was more that they were all playing against each other , and not just one another on purpose to get better at their roles ... but yeah I agree with you ! :D lt 3
I got mine from a local shop in my town that sells custom made shoes and they're pretty cheap too !
We have a lot more to learn . We need some time in order for our brains and bodies adapt .
I'm sure you're right , but I think there's a difference between denying and acknowledging something like this happened ...
I have the same thing but for me its always zen or dva because of my team comps lol ...
I think it was a bit of both . I'm not sure what happened there but they were in and out within minutes so maybe just some people got caught ? Idk ... shrugs
Same here . The only thing that's changed is the music , but it still has some great levels and bosses to explore !
I'd take him over KP any day of the week , but I'm not sure that's what you're looking for ...
He's a good player but not the greatest of all time like Messi or Ronaldo are in my opinion ...
I'm sure she is , but I don't think it was her fault that they were all there at once and not just one person yelling over everyone else ... ?
I'd love to see a remaster of BulletStorm on PS4 and XB1 ! I've been waiting since it came out ...
I agree with this guy ! He's right and he knows what we're talking about here :D
I think it's actually somewhere else . I've never seen that lake before and thought maybe there was another one nearby ...
I was thinking more of a mix between the two , but I can see where you're coming up with that one too ! :D Thanks for your input though lt 3
It's a good smell , but it doesn't really come in an airtight container like you'd think ! It just gets stuck to everything and is very unpleasant smelling ...
I'm not sure , but I think it's because they're trying to make a living off their popularity .
I've never had it , but I'm sure you could find some . It's not bad at all though !
I'm not sure what you're talking about ... I think we all know that the only thing worse than a team from Wisconsin is one with no flair ! s
I've been meaning to get into them ! I'll definitely give this one a listen when they come back on the radio again in September or October time frame ? Thanks man :D lt 3
You will be able to see your ban history . You should have a message from the admins saying you are unbanned , but it's probably just an error in their system ... :P Edit : spelling ! D: lt 3
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I hope it's sarcasm ... but that would require some sorta sense to understand what was said in this thread .. ? :P Edit : spelling error fixed now lolz
173664 I don't know what to do with my life now ...
I mean , it's not like they're going to win anyway so why bother ? I'm sure EU will be fine with their picks and bans though ! :D s
I agree , but I'm not sure if it would be a good idea to drive around at night ...
Flair up !
I think you mean fifth son .
I'm sure you're right . I just don't want to be that guy who says something and then gets downvoted for saying so ... :P But thanks !
I'd like a pm too please . Thanks ! :D Edit : PM'ed you the link in case anyone else wants it as well ... thanks again for sharing your work with us all lt 3
I'll take it . It was a good deal , and the food is great !
I'll try that out ! Thanks for the suggestion :D I'm not sure if this is a bug or intended but thanks anyway and good luck with whatever happens next ... lol .. haha hahaha XD xd lt 3 uuuuuhhh ? oooohhhhhhhh hmmmmmmmmm mmkayyyyeeeesssss
She's got the same collar as my dog , and she is very small ! She only weighs about 15lbs though ... so I'm not sure if that helps or hurts haha :P lolololllll
I remember those ! They were so much better than the current ones that they're still in use today ... and it was cheaper too :D
He was a beast at U20 Euros too ! He is going to be so good when his career really starts getting underway ... I hope it happens soon though :D lt 3
I think it's more that the kid doesn't know what they're saying and just wants a laugh , but I agree with you on this one !
I think it's the other way around , but I could be wrong about this one ...
I'm not even sure what I expected from the start of the season , but it's been pretty good for me !
They're all in their seats . It's a pretty big arena so they have lots of time for it .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote you for that one ...
Bobby Petrino amp the lack of talent in his program .
I love mine ! It's so much fun to play with , especially when you get the right size of mousepad :D
I'm sure they're all just happy to have someone else come over for their anniversary , right ? ! Right guys ... Guys .. ? s
It was probably trying to get a treat .
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling . Either way I laughed at your comment so hard that my stomach hurt for some reason lololollolo ! :D lt 3 u bbz
I'm a big fan of the show too ! I've been watching since season 1 and have only gotten better each time lolololloloooloo
He did , but they're not gonna believe him because of his hair color and how much money he has in offshore accounts ... oh wait ..
I thought it was a reference from The Last Samurai .
I'm not Canadian but I am a US citizen and have been living in the states for about 10 years now ... so yeah ! :D
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted , it's true that a lot of these games have been made for children and teenagers but they still sell well enough to keep them alive ... ? ! srsly .. lolololoolllll :D DDDddddduuuudeee d: lt 3
I'm not even close .
I'm sure there are plenty of places that would be cheaper than the city for housing and food ... but not all cities can afford them either ! :P
Because they're not in danger of being hit by a truck . They were just trying to get out safely , but that's all .
I'm hoping they'll do it with Mario Odyssey too ! I'd love that on switch if possible ...
I've lived in both places . Donut shops here have a lot more variety than most other countries'don't they ?
I'm sorry for your loss . I hope you have a good day ! :D lt 3
I think it's more likely that they'd just get a little bit of friction in their hair .
I'm not sure why I was downvoted but okay then lol ! Thanks guys :D
It's a great show , but you should probably wait until after season 2 or 3 if your interested on more of the characters and their arcs ! :D D: lt
I'm not sure if he's actually been that bad , but I've heard people say the same thing about him and it seems like they're right ...
I think he was just trying for a touchdown . He didn't dive at all and I don t know what that has anything do with whether or not they called him down ... lol ! :P Edit spelling error .. sorry guys hahaahaahhahahaaaahhhhaa haaaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhhhheeeeeeelllllleeeerrrrrdddooooooonnnnnggggeekkkkkssss
It's a good trick !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but I've never seen it in the wild before ...
I'm American , I don't have ads on my TV ... but if they were there in America then that would be an issue for me too ! :P But yeah .. adblockers are awesome though lolololllzzzz lt 3333
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I think it's a good thing that he was crucified , because then we wouldn't have to hear about him anymore ! s
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I think your comment is pretty funny ! :D
I'm sorry , I don t understand . Can someone explain this to me please !
I think he's saying that the property taxes on it are going up .
I'm sorry to hear about your child , but it is a good thing they are not in the habit of drinking themselves into oblivion ! Good luck with everything else though ...
I think it's the fans of both teams .
I think you mean top tier adjecent of the highest ranking member in a group with only one other person who's not on that list ?
I think you mean spherical , but I'm not sure ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but that is a pretty good description for this guy in my opinion ! :D
I think he's talking about Ronaldo .
Thanks for the clarification :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but I don't think there is a champ like this .
I'm sure that's a good thing for them ... right guys .. girls ? Guys ?
I think it's a good bet , but I don't know if he'll be able to pull off that kind of production with his new album coming out soon ... maybe next year ? :P
I've never heard that before , but I'm sure it's true !
u wahhab is the only one I know who has been active in here for quite some time and he seems pretty cool !
It's not boring if you're watching it for years and decades , though ...
I think you're on the wrong subreddit buddy ...
I'm not even mad , I was expecting this comment from you ...
I was thinking the same thing ! It's like a reverse rick roll lololollolo
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I agree with your sentiment and will be looking for a source on it now ...
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I think the US is a good ally and would be willing if they were attacked in any manner ...
I like them all but echo fox is my least favorite of those three ...
He's not . He was just an actor for years before he became president of America , and then got into politics after that .
Because it's not about losing , but winning and getting paid millions of dollars to do so ...
It is but that's not what he said ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling but I think it's a joke because of all those people who say that the duck is real and therefore can't be faked ! s
I'm sure he's not the only one who has been given that warning , but I don't think they're going around telling everyone about this stuff like some people do ... ? ! s
I'm a big fan of both ! I just think that Wally is more iconic than those two .
I think it's a requirement . I've never had one , but if they're not required then why are there so many of them in this country ...
I'm sorry for your loss !
I'm in a gym with 2 sand shrooms atm ... I wonder if they're spawning ?
I think he's a better fit for the offense . He can't be that bad at all , but I don t know if we re going with him over JTs or not ... yet ! lolololloloooloo
I agree , but I think it's more about the lack than anything else ...
It's not , but it does show how much he cares about his image and reputation as a president . He has no shame in admitting this fact either ...
I think you mean the guy who posted a picture of his face on Twitter , not me ! :P But yeah ... that was pretty bad too lololollolo
r toomany is pretty good , but I'm not sure if they're still around .
It's not like they're going through the same process as you do , but yeah ...
I think it's a good question , but I'm not sure if the results are statistically significant enough for me to make an informed decision on whether or not they're true ... yet ! :P Edit : spelling error correction ..
We're all getting bantered on this blessed day .
I would if I could .
I love mine , but you'll have to be more specific on what kind of riding you want to do with your new one !
He's a good player , but he doesn t have that much experience . He s not even close in terms of playing style and technique with Bayern Munich though ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling ... but I think he was being sarcastic about how much sunlight there actually is on a lake .
Thanks ! PM'd you the link in a reply above this one :D
I've been there before ... not fun ! But good luck to ya man hope everything gets better for yah soon lt 3
Thanks , it's been tough but we're all getting there !
I'm not a Chelsea supporter but I'll be cheering on him to win it all !
You should probably get that looked at . It's not good to be sitting on the couch all day and getting hurt like this !
I'm not sure if that's a joke or an actual thing . I think it was just meant as a way of making the point more obvious , though ...
I did . I'm hoping for a good day today , but it's looking like that won't happen lol :P Thanks though man and thanks to everyone who helped out with this post too haha lt 3 u guys ..
Swiss here , can confirm .
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling but I'll take that as an insult ! Haha thanks man appreciate it though :D
I have a galaxy s4 and it has the option to turn off notifications in settings but not in the app itself ...
OSUs defense has been pretty solid . They're just getting beat up by the offense and not making any stops on drives that would have resulted in points for them anyway ...
That's a good choice ! I love me some tacos and burritos , but not sure if that would be enough to make up for all of this ... lolololloloooloo
I have no idea what's going wrong then ... I'm not sure if you're using an older version or something ? It should be fine now though ! Thanks again :D lt 3
I'm glad you're not pregnant anymore ... or at least that's what my wife tells me anyway lololollolo
He's a good guy , but not really . He just wanted his own little world that no one else could have had .
You can do it twice . Once for a single player game and again if your in multiplayer mode with friends or family members , but not online .
You're not alone in that opinion !
I think it's more about whether he wants to play for us or not and if we want him back at Chelsea then I don't see why not ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling ... but I love that subreddit so much more than this one now :D
I'm pretty sure that seals don't even exist in the ocean ... so I guess they're just like dolphins and whales ? Or something ..
I think you mean President Elect Trump , but yeah ...
I'm glad you enjoyed it ! I had fun making this , and wanted people who didn't know about r BabyBabiesToWatchItFor 55 SecondsOfTheVideo :D Thanks again ! lt 3
I'm sure you're right that it's not a good thing for football clubs in general ... But I don't know enough of them or their finances so maybe they can afford better coaches ? ! s :P Edit : grammar correction ..
I'd take Alex over Colt any day of the week , but it's not like he was playing well before his injury either ...
It's a big deal , but the article says that there are no survivors so far ...
I think you mean Death Note : The Movie .
I think you're right ! It looks like her legs are bent at an unnatural angle and then bend back to normal position after each rep ...
He's a great guy , I hope he stays with us for awhile ! He seems like such an awesome dude and has been very humble about everything so far this season too ...
Yeah that's what i was thinking too !
Done . Please return the favor back to me ! Thanks in advance :D
I'm still hoping they'll do a Star Wars film in the future but I don't think it's likely at all ...
I have that one too ! I love it :D
I agree , but I think it's still worth mentioning that they're not as cheap to maintain or repair in comparison with other manufacturers like BMWs Mercedes Benz etc ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but I'll take your word as a fact that he's been gone forever ...
Nigeria is in the group with Argentina . They are not playing each other at all this year so it's a tiebreaker for them if anything happens between now amp then ! :D edit : spelling error fixed that one up ...
I'm sure he's not the only one who feels that way . I think it was more of an indictment on our defense than anything else , though ...
I'd say that's pretty much what happened .
He knows what she wants .
I'm sure he's not making that much in a month or two of work ... but I don t think you can say the same about his wife and kids either .. ? lol ! :P s
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I agree with your sentiment nonetheless !
1 : r askreddit and I'd love a place that's not too far away from me , but also has some cool stuff going on there as well ...
I think it's more likely that Saric gets traded than he stays in Philly ... but I could see them keeping both players at least until next season or something like this .. ? ! lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwwwwweeeeelloooooooooohhhahahahaha hahahahaaaahhaaheeeeeaaaaghhhhhhhhaaaaawyyyewwhuuuughuhhrrrrbsnnggggghtsssiiiiienn
I'm not sure about that , but we'll see !
She's not in the picture , but if you go on google images and search for'Lady Stoneheart'it'll show up with some pretty good results ! :D She looks amazing though ...
I'm with you on that one , but the Chevrolet ones are pretty good for what they do and how much money it costs to make them ...
I'd be okay with that . I think they're going in a different direction than last year , but it's still better then what we got from them this time around ... ? ! s Edit : spelling error fixed .. thanks guys lolololoolllllooooooooloooohhhahahahaahhahahhaa
I think the idea was that they could be used in a way to make them unique and interesting .
I'm not sure what you mean by this . Are they NPCs ? Or just a bunch of random characters who have no connection to anything else but themselves or their own universe's lore ... etc .. ect , whatever ! :P
It's not even that , it looks like an old wooden ship or something ... I don't know what kind though !
I think it's too short for that length of time and I don't want to play through all those side missions again ... :P But thanks !
I'm Indian and I don't think that's true . Most of us have been wrestling since the early 90s or so ...
You're right ! I'm a nerd for sure but that's just me being picky about what games to get into ...
I'm not sure what you're getting at but yes they do .
He is fluent in english . I think it was his first language when they were filming this episode , so maybe that helped him a lot with pronunciation and stuff ! :D Edit : spelling mistake fixed ...
I'm sure they're not going for jobs in other countries either ... but I guess you can say what's good enough is all we got here ! :D s
I think it's the guy from The Dark Knight Rises .
Fnatic will be the best team in NA , and they are gonna get a spot at Worlds ! :D
Or that one movie where he was an alien for like 10 years but then got his powers back after being dead or something ..
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but I think it's pretty funny how much people hate on us for our lacklustre performance in tournaments and such ... :P Edit spelling ! D: lt
I think the only reason they would retire is if they got replaced by someone better and more experienced in their position ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this happened ... but it's a good thing they're doing anyway ! :D
I'm not saying it's bad , I was simply pointing out that they're both terrible movies and should be avoided at all costs if possible ...
Because you're a kid .
Cincinnati is a great team . They're just not very consistent at the moment and they've been playing with their feet for too long now that we have our QB back ...
We're not playing you guys this year , but we'll be there next season if y'all make it that far ! We've got some great players on our team too ...
You're not alone ! This was at the casino across from the strip club .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it's pretty obvious he was joking about how much they hate each other lol ...
I think he meant it as a joke about how they're both villains and have no real connection aside from being friends or something like that ... ? I dunno lol ! :P
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I think it's a bit too early in the morning here and that might be why he said congratz instead ? :P Edit : spelling ! D: lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but that's the correct usage in this context ... ?
I'm not sure what that has anything do with my comment , but I'll take your word for it anyway ! Thanks though ...
I think it would work well with a new logo . I'm not sure what the current one is though .. maybe something like : The New York Jets ! or something similar to this idea lololollolooolooohhhahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhhhhhhheeeeeehee heeeehooooo hoooohoahhooooooooaaaaaaa
I think it's just the same as any other champion . They'll all be different skins with animations and such like that .
We're not even close . We have a better record than them and are in our division .
I'm a big fan of the Law and Order theme song !
I think it's a good idea , but I'm not sure how much weight they would have to add for them to work well in this configuration ...
I'm aware but it doesn't help that the last two movies are so good ! :D
I'm sorry for your loss , but I hope you have a good day !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of my username ... but I'll take it as an insult ! :D Thanks for your input though lt 3
I do , but I don't get paid in Karma . It is all about the money and how much it costs to make up for lost time on the internet ...
It's more than just the amount , it also includes interest and fees on top as well ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but that was my first thought too lolololo
I'm not sure if that's an insult or just a reference to something I've heard before ... but either way , it was funny ! :D Thanks for watching !
I mean ... yeah .. but still pretty much useless for edit : spelling error fixed up
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but I think it's a good thing that people don't believe in the same things as us and just accept them for what they are ! :D lt 3 hugs
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I don't think it's happening any time soon ...
I've never had the Frosties , but I'll have to try it out . Thanks ! :D
I'm still waiting for Snake to be in PM , but I think it's too late now ...
You mean like what ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take your word for that one ! :D
I think you mean Malleable .
Or my axe ? I mean , it's just an ax ...
I think so . They have to beat Bama and FSU though ... but I don't see that happening with a win over Alabama or Florida State in their current state of affairs .. lol ! :P Edit spelling error fixed it's not possible hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
I'm not sure if I should be excited or scared that this could happen ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote you for that comment , but it's a good one nonetheless ! :D
No worries . Thanks again man :D lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious , but it's actually pretty good ! It has some of those weird flavors like pepperoni or something ...
It's not that bad if you're used to the scenery in other places like Amsterdam or Paris ... But yeah I agree with your sentiment about brugge being too touristy for me :P hahaahaha ..
No , they'd still be in the group . They're just not guaranteed to advance if Spain wins or draws against them and vice versa for France .
It's still growing ! We're just getting started , but we have some great ideas for future content to come up with as well :D
It wasn't . He got the ball first and it hit his chest . It's an easy call to make but he didn t get any contact on the replay I saw either way ...
Or they're just going really fast and have no idea what's happening in front of them ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic but I agree with your sentiment and would like to see the committee reward harder schedule's for OSU more than anything else ...
I think you mean Hibara .
I think they are just really good at attacking . I've seen them hit the same spot twice and then go away after that ...
Because it's the same guy . He just has different clothes and makeup on , but that doesn't mean his face is completely normal or not creepy at all ...
I think it's a reference from The Office , but I could be wrong about that one ...
I'm sure it's not the best idea to use that kind if stuff on bears ... But I guess you could just be paranoid about them being dangerous ? :P edit : spelling error !
I think it's more of an inside joke than anything else , but I get what you mean by that ! :D Thanks for the info though haha lt 3
I think you mean if we didn't start at like 30 . We were up by 20 in that quarter and then went on a run to win it all ...
I'm in the same boat as you ! I've been playing a lot more with friends and family but it's just not for me anymore ... :P
You're a good neighbor ! I like that about your house too ...
I think you mean the movie that made me cry . I was so happy when it ended ! :D
I'm not sure if I should be offended or just amused . Either way , it's funny and makes me laugh ! :D Thanks for watching anyway though lt 3
She was in a lot of Sci Fi films , but I think it is mostly because her character and actress were both pretty big stars at one point or another ... ? :P Edit spelling ! D: D DD
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry at your comment ...
I was thinking about it for a while , but then realized that they're all in one piece .
I agree , but it would be nice if we could have some competition in our groups !
I think he's going back home for a year or two , but I don't know if it'll be in SA though ...
I'm not sure . I think it's more like 1 2 cup or so ... but the amount isn't really important to me right now ! :D
I think they're great , but I'm not sure if it's because I've seen them before or what ... But yeah , there is definitely some sorta charm to these movies ! :D Thanks for watching ! lt 3
I'm not saying he's dead ! But if you're going for the whole'they don't want me alive thing , why would anyone think otherwise about Mario Kart 8 Deluxe ? edit : spelling error correction fail
I think that's what he was trying to say ...
You're a good person .
I think they're trying to be more like England , but I don't know if that's what you meant by'never go full French ' ... ? :P Edit : spelling !
I agree , but it's not a bad thing to do in the end ! It is what you want and that makes life worth living :D
I've never been there but I'm sure its worse than Detroit or Flint ...
I'm sure he's a great guy . I just don't think it would be fair to have two of them in one room at once ...
I'm not sure what you're asking me but yes that's correct !
It was the best ending for Terminator 2 IMO and that is what matters to most people in this thread so far !
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think he's saying that there are no brakes on a motorcycle because it doesn t have any gears to begin with ... ? Edit : spelling error ! Thanks u jimmyjones 1 for pointing out my mistake lolololoolllllzzzzzzzuuuupsss
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic but I'll take it as sarcasm anyway ! :D
He's a vampire now ...
I agree ! I was so sad when it ended ... but that's what makes this show great :D It never gets old and you can't stop watching them all again .. lolololllll lt 3
It's not over yet !
I think that's the point of this thread ... ?
I'm from the same state and have never had one either , but it's still creepy !
It was an example of how they could have handled it better , but I agree with you that this wasn't really necessary and should be left alone for now ... ? ! s
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but I think that's what he was going for with his comment ...
I'm not a Muslim but I think that's pretty funny ...
It looks like a blood stain . I think it was from his injury last season , but he had to get stitches in there for some reason ...
I think we're just a little rusty , but I'm not sure what that has to do with anything ... ? We've been pretty solid this year though !
What's your current career ?
You're in for a rough time , my friend !
I'm not a fan of the helmet either ... I think it looks too much like an old school motorcycle helmet and that's just my opinion though !
The Jets ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . Either way it's funny because the Saudis have been doing this for years and no one bats an eye at them ... yet ! :P Edit spelling error ..
I think they did . I remember the first time it was on TV , and that was when we were in the playoffs ... so maybe not as bad but still pretty awful ! lolololllll :P hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
I think you mean'any secretly brilliant players hidden in the squad , I'm sure they'll be playing for us soon enough ! s
I'd be fine with this if it was just an option for me , but I don't want my phone being locked down by the company and forced into using their service ... sigh ! :P
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but it's a bit of an exaggeration if that helps your point at all ?
They're not native to Ireland , but they do live here and have been living for a long time on this island . I'm sure it's just an isolated case though ! :P Edit : typo error ...
He has a lot of money on this race and he wants to win as much as possible before his contract expires next year ... I think ?
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling but that's the best way of getting them in their natural habitat and then breeding them back into adults ! :D D: lt 3333cutey facehuggerzzzzzZs ...
I'm not changing my passwords . I just want a new account with no history and only one email address , so that they can't see it's me ! s
It's not that hard to understand , it just takes some time and effort .
I'm sure he was just trying to get his hands on some plutonium !
Or Disney Channel's Star Trek : The Next Generation , which is also on TBS and has been for years now ...
I'm not saying we won't get them but it's a lot of effort to just wait and see if the event will come out at all or nothing ... :P
I'm hoping for the same thing , but I think it's more of an insurance policy than anything else ...
Nope , you're not alone !
I'm not sure what you're getting at , but I'll take it as a compliment ! Thanks for being so nice about this whole thing though :D lt 3
He's not fat he just has an unhealthy lifestyle that makes him look bigger than his actual weight . He also eats too much junk food to be healthy either way ... lol ! :P s
I hope you're doing better now ! lt 3 hugs and love to all of us here at r bbq
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I've never seen anyone use Google Earth for anything other than a quick sketch of an area , though ...
A surprise ? ! But a welcome one nonetheless ...
I'm sorry to hear that ! Hope you have a great day night tomorrow morning :D
Kevin . I think it was a close fight , but he won by decision and got to keep his belt for another year after that win over Conor .
I think it's called a province , but that doesn't mean they're not part or even close to being in France .
I think you mean'The Poor People's Destiny ' ...
I think he's going to be a great player , but I don t see him being the best ever at this point of his life and age ... maybe not even close ? lol ..
Because it's a boring fight and people want to see him get knocked out ? I don't think that makes sense at all ... but whatever floats your boat man ! lolololll ..
I'm not sure if you're being serious but I think that's a pretty good idea actually ...
I'm not sure what I expected from this comment chain ... but it was still funny ! Have my upvote sir madam ! :D Edit : Thanks for your gold kind stranger !
I did too , but I was just wondering if anyone else had this problem or something like that ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic , but I think the 6 is a great phone and it's definitely worth getting for that price point ! It was just too expensive though ... :P Edit spelling error .. lolololoolllllooooooooloooohhhahahahaahhhaaawwwwwwaaaaaahhhhhhhhaaalrighty ?
Or , ya know .. just not use a computer .
Ricciardos car has a lot more power and he's faster . He also had some mechanical problems in quali , but that was fixed by his team .
I'm not sure what you're talking about , but I think they were both pretty good in college too ? Maybe it's just me though ...
I think the pronunciation is similar to how I would say it in French . It's pronounced like ay lee en and not as ay leen ee en though ! :D Edit spelling
You're not even close .
I think so . He's been playing well for us , and I'm sure we'll be looking to bring him back soon enough if not now !
I think you're already there .
I'm not sure . You might be able too ... but if they're in there then no one will ever find them !
It's treason then ...
I don t know about that but you can get one for like 10 bucks on amazon or something and it s not too bad if your internet isn t slow enough to stream torrents ... :P Edit spelling ! D: D lt 3 u bbzukklehgjdwfqeheu
I'm sorry for your loss , but I think that's the best way to get people into anime and vice versa ! :D
You're welcome to join us in r Pwned if you want a little more info on how we work with our community members as well ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is the first time we've seen him fight . He's a great fighter and deserves to get paid more money ! :D Edit : spelling error ...
He's not poor though ... He has an income that would be considered poverty level for most people if they were to live on it alone and without help from family or friends .. lol jk :P
I agree , but I think it is a bit more than just this one guy who was doing something wrong and got caught out by the system ...
I'm watching it on ESPN 3 , but I don't think they have a stream for us yet ? Edit : Nevermind ! It's up now ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but I think the first one is more likely to be true than this second ...
I'm sure it is , but I don't think that would be a reason for them being so far away in the first place ...
He was trying to get him out of there . He didn't want to be in that situation again , so he gave it back and walked away from the scene ...
Done , please return the favor ! Upvoted your comment too :D Thanks again !
Because they're not in the same country .
Navas has been playing well for the past few months though ...
Because it looks like one . It is , after all ...
I'm sure you're right , but I don't think it's a coincidence either way ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun ... but I think that was an actual quote from The Hitchhiker s Guide to Earthsea by Douglas Adams !
I'd buy that game so fast ! I would totally play a new one with all of these characters and stories , but they're not available yet ... sigh ..
I'm not sure what you mean by this ... but it's a comma and not an apostrophe so the error is probably due to lack of punctuation in your comment !
I love you too , I'm sorry for your loss ! hugs back at ya lt 3
I've never heard of that one , but the other ones are all over the place in England and Wales !
I'm not . I've never been to America , but my parents were born there and they're from Canada so ...
I'm not sure if you're serious , but it's a joke about the fact that he was in charge of all those things and then left for good reasons ...
I'm not sure if I should laugh at this comment , but it's true .
I'm going to try that , thanks for the suggestion . I'll post an update when it's done :D Thanks again ! lt 3
I'm sure you can find a way to get your money's worth out of that ...
He's a freshman . He has potential but he needs to work on his shot selection and decision making , which is why we have him in our rotation now instead of Dunn or Morris ...
You can get the WatchOS 2 App on iOS and Android , it's pretty good ! It has all of Apple's apps in one place so you don't have to worry about that much :P Edit : spelling error fixed ..
I think it's fair to say we're not going after him at this point in his career though ... I'm sure there are other teams who would take on some contract if needed ! :P Edit spelling error .. lolololoolllllooooooooloooohhhahahaahahaaaahhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaggggghjajajaawwwzzzsssaddddeeeektstttfbbbbsnngwqycbdkx
I think it was the same way with RDA . He just kept going until they stopped hitting each other in their faces lol ...
I'm talking about the original game , not the expansion that came out in late 2011 or early 2012 . The one with all those new things and stuff ...
I'm interested in the Quirky collection time ! PM me your address please :D
I'd be okay with that , but I'm not sure how it would work out for the rest of us ...
I feel ya man .. i have to say though its pretty funny how much people are laughing at your comment lol edit :D upvote
I thought it was him too ! He's got that look about his face when you see him on screen ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it's pretty obvious that he wasn't shooting at her and just wanted to get away from Cersei ... ? ! s Edit : grammar
I think he's gonna get the title shot if they don t want to do it now though ... I mean who else is going after that belt ?
I'm sure he's dead by now ... but thanks for the suggestion ! :D
It's a good comic , but it doesn't really belong here ... I think the mods are just trying to get rid of all these posts that aren t funny or interesting anymore .. ? ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed lolololloloooloo
I think it's more about how they were able to get their hands on that particular piece without being asked for permission by anyone else in the industry ... or something like that .. lol ! :P Edit spelling error haha xD sorry guys lt 3 uuuuuhhhhahahaha XD LOL XDDYyyyXd YEAH
I know , but I'm not sure if they were expected that much more than a tie or two ?
It's a reference to an old episode of South Park , where they have two chickens cross over and die from starvation or something like it ... I think ? It was pretty funny though ! :D D: lt 3
Priestess , she's the only one who can actually be considered to have any personality and not just being an annoying character with no plot armor . She has some great moments though ! :D lt 3
She has six , but only two are visible in the picture ... I think it's just a reflection from the camera lens ?
I've never seen one that wasn't full , but I have a few friends who go there and it's always packed with people in them ...
That's awesome , what kind are they and how much does it cost them if you don't mind me asking lol :D
It's not really that far from reality ... but yeah , there are some similarities between the two places and they're both pretty big cities with lots to do ! :D
It's not like they're going to be shooting in the same location every week , it'll just take them longer than usual for each shot and then some more editing .
That's awesome ! I'm sure you'll be able to get some good answers from the people who have been there before , too :D
Because it's not illegal to park in the street and use public transportation ...
I agree with you on this one ... It was a good call though !
I was thinking more like a young Michael Cera , but I see what you mean !
I think he's trying too hard , but I'm not sure if that is the case ...
I think it's because of my hair . It looks like she has darker brown eye shadow than her original color when she was kittens and now is dark red with black spots ... hmmmmm .. weird :P lolololllllzhahahahaha XD xD lt 3333
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote you for this comment ...
I did . It's a good thing he doesn't do that anymore , because it would be pretty boring to listen and watch him talk about the same stuff over amp over again ...
I hope he is a cameo , but not as much of one that we don't know about yet ...
Score more goals than the other team and then we'll know what's going on ! s
It's a common thing in my family , but it is not something that everyone knows about or cares to know so much as just an interesting factoid for me ! :D lt 3
I'm going to guess that they're both coming out in December , but I could be wrong on this one ...
I'm sure there are a lot more people who don't . I just thought it was interesting to see how many events were actually mentioned on this sub before today's announcement ...
You can't , they're all dead and buried in the ground by now ! s
I'm rooting against you guys , so that's a win in my book !
I think it's a good thing they didn't use any of those scenes for this movie because I would have been so disappointed if there was no one left alive in antman 2 ! :D DDDdddeephhhhsssrslooooooooorrrrrtttt
I'm going with a big mistake , but if you're right then we'll both have to go back in time for another season of this show ! :D Edit : typo error ...
It's the same thing as saying'football , soccer or basketball are all games played by humans ! '
I don't think they were that good , but I do remember them being up 3 1 at one point and then losing 4 straight games against Lebron's team ...
It's a bug . It was fixed in the last patch but I don't know if they'll fix this one either ...
The one after .
I think you're right on this one ... it's just a little annoying to see the same thing over and over again in every single thread lol ! Thanks for your input though :D lt 3
I'm a fan of the burritos . I don't like their chicken though ... but that's just me !
I'm not a fan of the team but I think they're doing alright . They've been playing well and have some good young players on their roster that can develop into stars eventually !
I think you mean if he didn't die before getting hit by malza's Q ? I don t know what happened there but i'm pretty sure uzi died first ...
I'm sure you can find some way of making the colors pop better , but that's just my opinion on how they should look in game :P Good luck with your project though man lt 3
Kobe fans are the worst , I've seen them in every thread about him and they're always making excuses for his actions lol ...
Lol , both .
Charlie Day would be a great Walter White , but he's too old for that role ...
I think he's at like 1lb . He was a little over 2lbs when we got him from the pound shop , so maybe that is why it dropped in size ... lol !
I'm not sure , but it's worth a shot . If you're in Canada or something like that then maybe try contacting them through their website and see what happens ! Good luck :D Edit spelling ...
Blue and Purple both have their place but I think the colors of the two colours complement each other well enough to make them look good together imo ! :D
I think it's more of a case where they don't care about animation , but rather just want to watch something with good animation and sound effects instead ...
I agree with this statement 100 percent .. It's a masterpiece in my opinion but not as good as the tick or jcvd
I'm not hating at all ... I just don t like the way it tastes and how much sugar they use in their drinks ..
I think it's just a one off show , but I could be wrong about that ...
I'm sorry for your loss ...
I'm pretty sure that was a joke .
I'm not sure what you mean , but I'll take that as a compliment ! Thanks for being so helpful and encouraging me on my journey through this sub :D lt 3
I'm sorry but the order is already placed for this person's orders ! Please try again in 30 minutes or so to be eligible for another delivery ... Sorry about that :P
I'm sure they'll have plenty of snipers in the next patch ! s
I'm sorry for your loss . I hope you have a good day !
It's a good look for her . She looks like she has the same hair as in season 1 , but it doesn't really match up with her face at all ! :P
I have the same pair and love them , but only for a few days at most before you get tired from wearing them all day long !
He's also the best actor on The Wire , and is probably my favorite character of all time !
Yeah , I was thinking about it too . The kid in front of him is probably a mvd or something like that but he's not wearing any shoes ... so maybe ? ! Haha ..
Happy Birthday !
I'm sure you're a great person , but I don't think that's what the OP was asking for ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll but I laughed pretty hard at this one ...
I am also jealous of your time zone ! :D
I think it's a good song though ! I'm not saying that he isn't talented or anything like that just don t know if there is something more to this story .. ? :P Edit spelling error lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwwwaaaaaaahhhahahahaaahhhaaawwaaaayyyyeeeewweeeeeehhhhhhhhheheeheeheeohoooooooooouuuuuhhhhhhheheheueughhehe
Tbh I think it's a good idea to keep both of them together and have one guy who can play defense on offense while they work out their differences in chemistry ...
I've heard about this place ! Where is it ? Is there any info on its existence or if you can find out more information online somewhere else ... Thanks for sharing your story though :D lt 3333
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic but I'll take your word for it because this is what happens when they don't get enough money to keep making them ... ? ! s
I'm interested . How much ? And how long did it take to get here in Canada ?
I was thinking more along those lines , but yeah he does ! :D
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ... I'll go with both ! :D
I think he's a good friend of mine , so it'll be interesting .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this is my first time seeing someone use the word'computer'in an internet thread ...
I'm sure they could find someone who can do it justice and make them look good ! :D But yeah ... not really my thing at all lolololoolllll XD xdxdxddeepoogoogeoooooooohhhgghhgggsdfjkfkkbbb ltsssrspppwewwwwwwweeeycbsnngrvzmfwqwerrrrt
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... I hope it's sarcasm ! :D But yeah that would be the best possible score for this game IMO ..
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious . I don't know enough about the lore of Warcraft , but it's pretty clear that she was a lot more powerful than Jaina is now ! :P ?
It's a good thing that you don't have to worry about your own safety when riding in this city ! s
I'm not a fan of either team , but I think they both deserved it .
He's a master of karate and friendship for everyone !
You can't because you're not a man or woman of any kind and therefore cannot be legally considered as such by your spouse's state .
I'm from Georgia and we still don't have that here ... yet .. :P But yeah , decriminalization is definitely something we need for our state .
I got mine for like 30 . It's a great book , and it has some really good illustrations !
I think that's what he meant by'legendary ' ...
I'm a spanish person and I loved it ! It's so weird to me that people think we're all crazy for liking this show ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic ... but I'll upvote anyway because it was funny and true at the same time ! :D
He's not that bad , he just doesn't play defense and can shoot the ball well enough for his team but I don t think it matters much at this point ... yet ! :D Edit spelling error lolololoolllll
He's the new face of WWE . He can't help himself , he has to be there for his family and friends who are in need or want him back on TV ! s
And then he gets arrested and has his head cut off by an angry mob , because that's what happened at my house once ...
You should try it . It's fun and you can get some good laughs out of them too if your friends don t like that kind of stuff :P
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
He is not bad but his finishing has been poor this year and it seems that he doesn't have confidence in himself to finish chances anymore ...
You're probably good . The AI isn't that great , but it's not terrible either and you can get some really cool stuff from them in game too !
It's a great touch , but I think it would be better if he was just dead and not burned alive like his brother is doing now ...
I think the whole thing felt like an episode of The League , except for that one guy who got shot in the head and died from cancer instead ! :P
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think this was an attempt at humor and he's just trying to be funny ...
I'm still waiting for a sequel . How long have you been playing since launch day ?
I've been trying to get into that lately ! It's a great book and it really helps me feel better about myself when i have depression or anxiety issues :D Thanks so much though lt 3333
He's got that extra chromosome , but he doesn't have any of his own chromosomes either ... so it looks like they're all in there somewhere !
The opposite is not safe . It's just a little safer than you'd think , but it doesn't mean that there aren t any risks to be taken in doing so ! :D D: lt 3 hugs and kisses for everyone !
It's on Netflix , but you have a lot of episodes and they're not all as good as season 1 or 2 ' s seasons . It gets better in Season 3 ! :D
I think it's just because he was born on that side of Germany ... I mean look at him ! He has to be an immigrant or something right ? s :P Edit : spelling error fixed ..
I'm not sure , but I think that's what they were doing . They probably had no idea how much their rent was going up and wanted something else instead ... lol ! :P Edit spelling error ..
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this comment ...
Because you're a man of culture ... duh s
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic but I like your style !
He had a lot more talent around him . He also played with the best players ever and won championships on both sides for sure but not quite like MJ did ... yet .. lololollolooolooowwwwwwoooohhhahahaahahaaaahhhaaawwaaaaaaaaghhhhhhhhheeeeeeelloooooowooooooooooohhhuhuuuughghgghgggeeeewyyyuggaaggylllgllaaaaaalrightnowhereforever
I think he's too good of an analyst . I'd rather have him as our head coach than ours ...
It wasn't even close though ...
I'm sure you're a great person , but I don't think that's what he meant by'we shouldn t ignore the problem because it s bad for us ! ' ... ?
I usually just go with my wallet and cash out at the pump if it's not convenient for me or something like that ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this ...
I think he's a bit too happy for that though , I'd say it was more like an act of respect than anything else ...
I'm not sure what you're talking about , but it looks like he has the same mustache as me !
I think it's a reflection of the camera lens , not sure though ... I'm just guessing here ! :D
They were probably wearing uniforms . They're the ones who wear them in battle , so I'm sure that's what was going on there ...
I think he is a great actor , but his character in this movie was just ... not funny at all and really didn't fit with what they were trying to do there ..
I think he's been playing there for a while now , but I'm sure it'll come down to rotation or something like that at some point in the season !
I've had a few people try to get inside of mine and it's always locked ...
It's a great show , and they're doing well with their new talent . They've got some good matches in there too !
I'm in ! Thanks for letting me know , but it's not like this is a big deal ... just wanted some feedback on my application before making an official announcement about it .. lolz ? xD lt 3 u bbqbeefywgjhfkxv
I think you're right . I'm just saying that the majority of Christians don't believe in it , and most people who do are Christian fundamentalist types anyway ... so there's a difference ! :P Edit spelling error .. lolololoollllloooooowwwwwwoooohhhahahaahahaaaahhhaaawwaaaaaaaayyyyuhhhhhhhhheeeeeeheeheeheeheeeehoooooooooo
I think you mean George Costanza ?
I think it's more that they're trying to get people talking about them . They've been doing a lot better than most reviewers have so far though !
That's what I thought too . It was a bit of an odd sentence , but that is how you would say it in my language anyway ...
I'm excited for the next one !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but it was a joke , and he didn't actually say that in his post . He said something like this : ' It is true ! '
I'm from the UK and we have them here too ! They're called'prawns'in America though ...
I did , but it didn't work for me ... I'm not sure what's going on with my game or how to get past this part of the map ? :P Thanks ! Edit : spelling error fixed lolololoolllll
I'm pretty sure it's because the mods are asleep or something like that ... I don t think they care about your posts though so you should be fine ! :D edit spelling error lolololoolllllz lt 3 u bb xoxo
I'm not really into RPGs , but I'd be willing for anything . What do ya have in mind ?
I'm not sure if you're joking or just really stupid ... but I think that was supposed be an inside joke in the movie ?
I'm sorry . I didn't mean anything by my comment but if someone says this in a thread about him they're gonna get downvoted into oblivion and deleted anyway :P Sorry for your loss ! lt 3
He's been playing well for us this year though ... I think he'll be fine in Houston !
I think you mean 5 7 ...
I'm a big fan of Kamigawa's creatures too ! I love all those things about it :D
I think it's more like 500k or so per year for the rest of his career if I remember correctly ? Not sure though ...
Because they're not in Australia . They are just trying to get rid of all that pesky metadata ! s
I'm pretty sure that was just an elaborate joke about the fact he didn't want his likeness being used in any way shape or form by anyone else ever again ...
I'm sure he was just trying to make money off of it , but I don't think you can really blame him if someone else is doing something worse than what they're supposed too do ... right .. s ! Right guysy ? Guysiesh ! :D D:
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling ... but I think it's the former ?
Because he's a good guy and has done some great things in the past ? I don't know , but that doesn t mean you can just throw out his name without any consideration ... right guys .. srsly !
I'm a man , and my job is not that hard !
I'm sure he's a nice guy . I mean , what did the Russians ever do to him ? ! s
I think that's the norm . I've never heard of anyone getting less than 6 months per year , but maybe you're right about this one being unusual ...
I'm going out for a walk in the park tomorrow morning ...
I'd watch that sketch !
Because they're a good basketball town . They'll take him if he wants them , but I don't think that will be enough for Cleveland or Boston ...
I thought the same thing , but I think that's because they were trying so hard not too show off their balloons and just showing them in an empty field ... ? Idk though lol ! :P
You're not alone !
I'm not sure what you're trying to say here ... I don't think it's a picture of me ? It looks like someone else took this pic and posted it on instagram .. lol ! :P sorry for being rude though hahaaahahahahahhaaaaahhhheeeehee heeeeeehhhhhhhh haaaaaaaaayyyyuhuuuughghg hooooooohhh gawd dangit uuuuuuuunnnnngggg
I'm not sure if this was meant as an insult or not ... but thanks anyway :D lt 3
I think it's more that they're both cute and have good personalities so why not ? I'm sure there are plenty of other cats out there for adoption too ! :D lt 3
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I think it's funny that people are downvoting this comment because they don't agree with your statement ! :D
It's a joke about how they're going through all of their old episodes and putting them on YouTube for free after they air again in September ! :D
It was an elbow to the face , so no it wasn't a yellow for me either but I'm sure you can get away with one if they're calling it correctly ! :P Edit : spelling error ...
I'm afraid so , yes !
I think it was a good game . The refs were just bad in general , but that's not saying much for this season ...
I think they're going to make a movie about the original Star Wars trilogy , and then remake them with this as an homage for the new movies coming out soon ! :D D: dddd ... wait .. what ?
I've seen plenty of chicks who have had babies from birds that were raised by chickens ...
I'm not sure if you are joking or serious ... but I think that's actually what they were going for with this one !
I think he meant to say : You're not an engineer ! That would be more accurate than what they said though ...
Yeah , that's what i'm hoping for too !
And Osama was never seen again ... until he died and his body went into hiding at the end !
I'm not sure if that's a joke or not . I think it was just an accident , but he didn't do anything wrong in the end anyway ! :D
I think you mean 24 hour news channels , not actual news stations like Fox and CNN or whatever they're calling themselves now ...
I got a lot of words that I didn't know .
I've had zero problems . It's been great so far !
I'll be on in a few hours or tomorrow morning EST ! If your still interested then let me know when you're available :D Thanks again !
I got a Shiny Wingull from the event , but I'm still waiting for my first one ... : c
I think he's more of an African American than anything else ...
I think they're trying to get the crowd into it and make sure everyone is happy with their decision making process before going home for dinner or something like that ? I dunno ... shrugs ..
I think it's more surprising that we're only up by 3 points , but I guess you can't really be surprised with a team like this ... right ? Right guys ! Guys .. ? s
I'm in the same boat , but it's not too late to start again !
It's a great series , but it gets better and better as the seasons go on ! It really is an amazing story with some of my favorite characters in it too :D lt 3
I'm already awake . I just woke from my nap and am now in bed with some coffee , watching this game on TV ...
I think we're at 7 . We need a few more wins and then they'll be in the playoff , but I don't see us beating OU or TCU anytime soon either way ... yet ! :P Edit : typo error fixed it's 8 now lolololoollllloolOLOooOOoohhh
They are not humans ... They have no rights or responsibilities in this country ! s
I think you mean the iPhone doesn t sell because people are buying iPhones for their hardware and not to be a cheap piece of junkware ? I m confused ...
I have a pair of those , but they're not very good . They don't block out all that much light and are pretty uncomfortable to wear for me at least ! :P
Yes . The refs are in charge of that rule now and they have to be consistent with their rulings on every play .
I was thinking more of Florida or Georgia but I guess you're right too ! :D
I'd rather have Pop in LA , but that doesn't mean he can't be here for another year or two ...
I think he was just trying out for his next role in The Walking Dead , but I could be wrong though ...
I think they are already in the works for Smash 4 . They have been working with Nintendo since Brawl was announced so hopefully we get some more info about them later this year ! :D DD
I'm not sure , but it's probably a joke .
I think he's a better pass rusher than veas though ?
I think it's more about the fact that we're playing in a friendly . I don't see why you'd want them losing , but whatever floats your boat ! :P
He's not even American , he just lives in America and is an immigrant from there who has been living here for years now ...
I thought it was a guitar ... I'm not sure why though , but that's what my brain told me too when reading your comment ! Haha :P Thanks for pointing out ! lt 3
I'm not sure what you're talking about , but we have a pretty good starting 5 right now and it's been that way for years ...
Yeah I've heard that too ! It's a shame because they're all great places but the cost is just insane ...
I'm sure it was just an elaborate joke .
I'm sure they would've had to pay for it if that happened ...
They did . It was a good call , but it wasn't PI or anything like that ...
I think it's safe to say that the only reason he didn't marry her is because of his wife and kids ...
He's been doing it for years now ... he just doesn't have the arm strength or accuracy of Favre anymore so they're trying something new with him instead ! s Edit : spelling error fixed .. thanks u jonnyjones 1
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that we're ranked higher than us ... but it is nice to see our win over them finally come around ! :D lt 3
I'm not sure what you're talking about , but my name is actually u TheRealDankestRedditor and that's the only reason why this post exists ...
I think we're both pretty happy with the way things are going in VA right now ...
I'm not a communist . I just like to party !
I think he's just gonna name them after himself .
And my axe ! Wait ... wrong movie ? :P Edit : Oh , and also a cameo appearance as a kid on The Simpsons Movie .
He's a real life Captain Hook !
I think he's going to be a great coach for years but I don t know if it s worth that much money or not yet lol ... maybe in 10 15 yrs ? ! :D
I've never been there but I'm sure it is a thing ! Thanks for the tip :D
I'm sure they'll find something else that will distract us ... like this one time in history , when we were distracted by a cat eating its own tail and then it died ? s
I think it's just because they're so big and fluffy ! It makes them look like little pieces in my opinion ... but maybe you could try to make your own version .. lol XD xD lt 3
I loved it , but not as much as the first two movies in my opinion ...
It's not even close . Brazil vs Germany was bigger than this one , but it wasn't a world cup final either way so I don t think that counts as an upset for you guys .. :P ! s
Because it's a common assumption . It was also an example of how people can be so easily swayed by things they read on the internet , especially when there is no proof ... s
I think he means the ball is going to go in . Not that it's gonna happen or anything like that ... but I could see how they'd interpret this as such ! :P Edit spelling error lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwwwaaaaaaahhhahahaha hahhaaawwaaaayyyyeeeewweeeeeehhhhhhhhheheeohuhuughuuuuuehauuhuaaahhahaha
I think they're going to try and get him . He's a good fit for them , but he doesn't have much upside at this point in his career imo ...
I do , but I'm not sure if it's worth getting a new console just for that game ...
I'm not sure if this would be a good thing or bad ... but either way my legs are sore from running so much in one day ! :D D: lt 3
They had a lot of food and water . They probably ate more than their weight in meat , so that's why it was hard to get them wet ... or something like this .. lolololllll :D D: d dddeeeepsss :p sssshhhhhh :P pppffffffftttt : PPPfffuuuuhhh :P
Melos a beast . I think he's the best player in the league right now , but it doesn't mean that his team is better than any other one of them ... yet .. lolololllll ! :D lt 3 melooo
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I'll take your word for it , but that's a pretty good analogy in my opinion ! :D
I think you mean the school ...
I think that was a joke , but I could be wrong ...
It is an acorn ...
You're not a real human being if you don't have an immune system ! s
I'm not sure what you mean by run but I agree with this statement 100 !
I think they have a few , but I'm not sure if it's the same ones as in America or what their breeds look like ... sorry !
I'm surprised it didn't get more attention , I thought the movie was pretty good and had some great actors in it too !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I'll take it as sarcasm anyway ! :D
I'm from Ambo too ! I've been there for years and it's still my favorite place to live now that I have kids .
You can't ? ! That is so sad ...
I'm down with that ! I like it when we play teams who are actually good at football and not just a bunch of kids playing on their phones all day long ... lolololooololllllooooooowwwwwwoooohhhahahaahahaaaahhhaaawwaaaaaaaayyyyuhhhhhhhhheeeeeeheeewooooooooooshiiiiiieeeehhhhhhahahahaha haHAAHA HA HAAA HA HA HA
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , so here's an upvote . :D
I'm a big fan of Arsenal , but it was definitely Chelsea for me as well !
I think the album has been pretty good , but I'm just saying she doesn't have as much songs like other artists do in comparison with their popularity ...
That's what I'm hoping too ! But if that doesn t work out ... maybe we can try something else ? Like an alternative subreddit or something like r nootropicscirclejerk :P Edit spelling error lolololoolllll
I think the defense is playing well enough to keep them in it but not so much that they're winning games by themselves ... I'm just guessing though ! :P Edit spelling error fixed now lolololoolllll
I'm sorry for your loss ...
I'll look into it , thanks !
I think it's a good idea , but the jump around is just too much fun to watch for us fans of other teams'traditions !
I'm sure it was the avocados , but I think they were also very dehydrated and had to drink lots of water before hand so there's no way for him not to heal ! :D D: lt 3
No , he was booked for dissent and then sent off after that incident with Costa's elbow on his face . He got carded because of it though ...
I'm so glad someone else caught this . It's a great line , but it just doesn't fit in with the rest of his dialogue ...
I mean we're not that good but it's still a pretty big step up from last season and the one before ... so yeah probably lol ! :P But yay for Duke ? Lolololll
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll . Either way , I laughed at this one ! :D
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry ...
I'm not even sure what that means , I just know it's a joke and people are being sarcastic about how bad of a console they have lol ...
I'm sure that'll work out well for your crops ! :D
I've had two of those in one day ...
I'm in there , but it's not letting me connect ...
I'm pretty sure that was a joke ... I hope it wasn t though lol ! :D
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic but I think it was a joke about how many times this exact thing happens on Fox News and other networks ? !
I think it's because they're not going to be able to sign him . They have a lot of cap space and he doesn't want that . He wants more money elsewhere ... ? ! s Edit : spelling error fixed now lolololoopsie
I'm not sure if you're serious , but they have a new location in the same building as the old one now ! It's called The Caulfields .
I've never heard about this , but now that you mention it ... It sounds like a great game ! Thanks for the recommendation :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but I think it's funny that this was downvoted so much for being true lol ! :D
Yes , they have . They were in the same group as OG and CLG at MLG Anaheim .
I think it was a mod , not sure though ...
I'm not sure if it's a joke or not . But the guy who posted that is actually teaching me how to use my phone and stuff like that !
I think you're right ! That's a great song too :D
I'm sure you'll be fine ! Good luck with the new home though :D
It will be interesting , but I think he'll still have the same problem as before . He can't really do much with his ult anymore because of how slow it is now ... ? ! :D D:
Because he's a doctor . He knows what he is doing , but it doesn't mean that his patients are going through this stuff without him being there for them ! :P
I'm a big fan of The Brew House , but they're all pretty good !
The great depression is already over ... so no civil wars for you ! :D
It's a common mistake , but the correct way would be : From or To .
You're welcome , I'm glad to see someone else is getting into this game and enjoying it as much as me right now haha ...
I'm not even mad . I just want to see some good basketball from both teams in the playoffs !
I'm sure they're just eating the babies . They don't have to be human sized or anything like that ...
I use a credit card . It works well for me and it is easy enough that you don't have any issues with spending money on things like groceries or gas etc ...
Yeah it's gonna be awesome ! He s got some good songs in there too so hopefully we ll get to hear more soon :D Thanks for sharing this man ! lt 3
I'm 5 foot 9 with a 175lb deadlift max ... so you're not alone ! Good luck man :D
I've done this before and it works great !
I got mine from a local shop called The Kitchen . They have tons and lots in stock now too so you can get one if they don't sell any more ... lolololllll :D D: lt 3333c3y0m4u5z8h6x7g2e1d9fjkqwvb4a
6 ' 9 or 6.5 if I remember correctly . He's listed at 5 foot 10 but he looks like a little taller than that to be honest lol Edit : typo in his height !
I'm a size 12 , so it's not too bad for me !
It's a Germanic language . It has the same roots as English , but it doesn't use words like'holland and Holland'or'dutch'etc ..
He threw a good one , but he didn't win .
I think it's more that people thought they would be able to beat Germany , and then the Germans were just better than them in every way possible ...
I'm not sure if you're serious ... But there's no way you can watch replays without pausing it every time someone dies . It would be like playing with your friends'phones ! :P
I've built a few RC airplanes and they all have died . I'm not sure what your point is ... ?
I have like 20 or so and i'm not going to get them all ... but if you want some more then sure :P
I think he's afraid because it would be a waste to have his son die , but I could see how you'd feel like this too ...
There's a lot of us ! I'm not sure if it counts though because we're all in the same room at work and playing together ... :P But thanks for your comment anyway lt 3
They were so salty . It was hilarious to watch them try and defend it lol !
It's called a map . It was free on google play store and I think it is also available for iOS android devices as well !
I think they're just a sponsor for their stadium , but I could be wrong about that one ...
I'm glad someone else remembers that song ! It was so good , and it fits with the theme of this episode perfectly :D
I'm surprised that the number is so low , but it's still a lot higher than what we have now in some places !
I'm white and have been doing this for years ... It is definitely useful !
Don't be afraid to ask questions , and don t worry too much if you get a weird reaction from it or anything like that ... just keep going at your pace :D Good luck ! lt 3
I know , it's just that you're so much more positive than most people are when they get to the end of their life ...
He's a professional at this point and has been doing the same thing for years now ... I think you're right though !
I think it's a joke . He has been voted in as the best player on his team by fans and media alike , but no one votes him up there ... yet ! lololollolo
I think the point is that it was an advantage for them , not necessarily a win or loss in any way shape form of competition .
I think it would be cool if they did something like this for every touchdown , just to see how many times you can say that before someone gets hurt or dies ...
Ah , I see what you mean now ! Thanks man :D
I hope so . I loved her in the first season of The League , and she was great as a host on that show ! She's definitely my favorite character though ...
I'm sorry for your loss .
I think you mean BSU , but I agree with your sentiment nonetheless !
The king in the north !
I think he's referring more about how long it took him to get there , not that he was actually on time or anything like that ... but still ..
I'm sure he's just using it for his own personal enjoyment , but I think you should be able too if they are microwaved and have no label on them ... ? ! s Edit : spelling error fixed that one up lololz ..
I think it is also a common name of some people who live there and are from Germany ...
I'm not sure what that means ... but it sounds like a good idea ! :D Thanks for the help guys lt 3
I'm a Saints fan and I want the bears to win so bad !
I'm sorry you feel this way about my comment ! :D But seriously though it was just an example and nothing more .
It gets much worse , especially if you watch with friends or family who are not fans of anime like me ...
5 10ths of a foot ? I'm 6 feet and my average height was about 4 inches taller than him ...
There's always the possibility of an antagonist , but I don't think it'll be one that we've seen before or anything like that ...
They are so good . I'm not a fan of vanilla , but this one is amazing and it's only like 2.50 for two flavors ...
I'd watch it , but I don't think that's what OP is looking for ...
I think it's more of a case for him to be happy with his performance and not care about who won , but I agree nonetheless !
I'm not sure if you are being sarcastic or serious ... but I think it's a good idea to keep them out of Germany , so we can have peace and prosperity again ? :D D: s
A pair of jeans and some socks !
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I think it is more like 30 40 days if he was playing at the same time as me ...
That's awesome ! I've never seen that before , but it sounds like something you'd see in an episode of The Twilight Zone or something ...
Meditech ? I've never heard of that company before ... Is it a brand name or something like that ?
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but I think it's a good book and the author was very well known for his work in that era of literature ...
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this is a thing .
It's a lot more open . I think it was the weather that made our fields look so much better than they actually were last season !
I've seen it . It's not bad but I don't think the story is as interesting or compelling as some of his other movies like The Big Lebowski and The Departed ...
That's what I saw too !
I like this one better because you can't just say'time has been moved forward by a few seconds since the previous play was made ! '
Logic is a tool for making sense and not being wrong ...
You're just jealous because you don't get to use your legs as much ! :P I'm sure that's what he was thinking when writing it , too ...
I'm sure they're doing it for the money . I don't think anyone is saying otherwise , but if you want a job in this industry then go ahead and apply ! :D Edit : spelling ...
I'm not sure , but I think the first season was available for free through Amazon Prime . It's been a while since I've watched it though so maybe that helps ! Thanks anyway :D lt 3
I'm not even mad . That was amazing ! I love the way he plays with his hands and moves around like nothing happened lolololoollooloo
Yeah I'm not sure why they do it but yeah that's a bummer ! Hopefully the next update will fix this issue though :D Thanks for your input man appreciate it lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've seen a few of these in the wild recently ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this ...
I think you mean semi's . Semis is the final of Bo1 ' s in NA LCS .
That sounds like an awful idea to have on your resume ...
I'm a browns stoke supporter too !
I think he's a great actor , just not in this film .
I think he means the first one . The second is only for people who have been in the game since launch , so it's not really that long of an achievement ... yet ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolololoolllll
I think that's a dog . I'm not sure though , it looks more like an owl to me ...
She's not bad , just overpriced and underwhelming for her size range imho ...
Yeah , I've got it set up to use the Phillips drivers and they're fine for me too ! Thanks though :D
She's just trying to get her own little slice of cake !
I'm jealous of you right now ! That's a great deal , man ...
I'm not changing factions , I just don't like the idea that we have a new system for every single player . It's too much work and it would be boring ! s
I think it's more of a no deal , I'm not going to pay you back ! type thing tbh ...
Ice town was a great movie ! I loved it too but the ending ... ughhh ..
You're not getting banned for this though ... You are just being reported and you will probably never see your account again if it's still there in a few days or weeks .. :P ! ? xD lt 3333
I'm American and have never watched soccer , but that sounds about right for me too !
I'm sure there are plenty . I think the problem is , it's not just one person who does this kind work but several studios and directors involved in the production process ...
You're not the only one ! It was great and very well made for what it is ... but there are so many other movies out there you could watch instead :P lololollolo
I'm so sorry . I hope your day gets better ! lt 3 hugs to all those who are feeling down today , too :D
I'm not sure about that , but it's definitely possible !
It was pretty bad when I first started playing but then my guild got better and we were all in love with each other again ! :D
I do . I'm a Canadian and have been living in Canada for years , but it's nice here !
He's not going anywhere , but he will probably have a bigger role in season 2 than Barry does now ... which means we'll see him more often ! :D
POB's CS lead to his team losing . He had no chance of winning that game if he didn't have enough cs for the first 2 minutes or so ...
I'm sure he'll be on the phone with them in a few minutes , but I doubt they'd want him talking about their team's record without any context of what happened last week ... lol ! :P Edit : spelling error ..
He's a good guy but I don't think that was the case here ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling ... but I think it's funny that people are downvoting this comment because they don t agree with the statement above them .. ? ! lololollolo
You're not alone .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I think it was sarcasm ?
Same here . It's a bit of an issue , but it happens to me all the time when trying out new things in game or something like that ...
I'm sure you'll be fine , but if your stomach is full of food and water then the next thing will probably be a lot worse than this ! Good luck though :D lt 3 hugs
I think he's talking about when Jesus gets hit in his head . He doesn't get up and walk away like that , but I could be wrong though ...
I think they're going to have some sort of event where everyone gets together , but not necessarily for sexual reasons ! It'll probably involve something involving food though :P Edit spelling error lolololoolllll
He's not evil , he just has no morals and doesn't care about what you think or do with your life ...
I've never had to deal with that , but if he's not feeding the enemy jungler is going to be really tilted by his ulti .
I'm sure he's fine , but I don't think it would be a good idea to throw him out of an airplane like that ...
I think it's a good thing they're not doing the black suits , because I'm pretty sure that would be too much for them to do in this universe .
I think he's a great actor but his character is so over the top and annoying that it makes me cringe every time i see someone say this to themselfs ... lol ! :P lt 3
That's a good point , I hadn't thought of that one !
I do , but I'm not a smoker so it's just for decoration lol !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but it's a reference to an episode from season 1 where they go through all that trouble and get nothing back ...
That's what I figured , thanks !
We can't afford to lose him , he's a good player but not worth the money that would come from trading for him in this market right now .. ? ! s Edit : spelling error fixed it lolololoolllll
I'm pretty sure that's a reference to his voice acting on The Venture Brothers and other shows like it . He was also an iron man in the comics too ! :D Edit : spelling error fixed ...
I think it's more about his personality than anything else , but I agree with you on this one ! He seems like an awesome dude and has great character development throughout the series ...
We get to play the Cubs in a few days , and they're going down 3 0 at home against us tomorrow night ... I'm not sure how that's gonna go for them though .. lolololllllzzzs
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that we're the only ones who have a sense about this game ...
He was just being sarcastic about your username lolololllll ! ssss
I'm going to be in town next week so maybe we can meet up ! :D
I'm sure they're insured by insurance companies and will be paid out as such if needed ... but yeah that's probably what it would cost them .
I'm sure you're right . But why would anyone want their own pet shark , when we can have our own little sharks and dolphins for free at the aquariums ... oh wait .. nevermind :P s
I'm not a fan either but I think it would be cool if they did something like that for the new heroes and stuff coming out soon ! :D
I'm not sure what you mean by spend wisely , but I agree with your sentiment that it's important to have a balanced budget and invest accordingly !
I think it's a reference to the fact he has no idea what his name means . He just says'ziggy Zigga ! ' and then goes on with life , I guess ... lololollolooolooohhhahahaahahhhaaawwwwaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhheeeeeeheeaaaaghhhhhhuhuuuughghgghgggeeeehjajjjkbbbabbeebdbaadddyyyzzzoooooowww
I'm sure you would , but it's not like she has to be a guy or anything ... just sayin ' ! :P
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I think it's pretty obvious that this was sarcasm and he wasn't trying too hard in his post :P !
They beat Kansas . That's how they made it to the tournament , and that was a good win for them too !
I think you mean 3 , but I'm not sure ...
I'm on it . I'll be back in a few days with more info about the study soon after this one is over ...
I'm sure the FBI would have found him if they had a warrant for his arrest or something like that .. but I guess not ! :D
I'm not sure if it's smart or stupid . I think the answer is both , but probably neither at this point in time ...
I think they're cute . But it's just a little too much for my taste , and not in a good way ...
Oh yeah ! That's right ... sorry about your cough though :P hope you're feeling okay now and getting back to normalcy quickly lt 3 hugs
Same here . I've been using this app for a while and never had any issues with notifications , but they're still there when you swipe back to the home screen ... weird ! ? :P Edit : spelling error fixed that one lolololoollooowwwwwwoooooohhhahahaahahhhaaawwaaaahhhhhhhhaaaaaaaayyyyeeeewooooooooooooshiiiiiieeeeeehheheeheeheehehehehuhuuhuuughgh
Yeah I agree with you there ! It's a great way to get people interested in what they're reading and then just go from there haha :D Thanks for watching though man lt 3
I'm not sure if you're being serious , because it doesn't happen to me at all ... But yeah that sounds like something that would be expected in the US . Thanks ! :D DDHahaahahahhhaa ..
I think it's spelled Dwyane , but I'm not sure ...
I've seen that one too ... but I don't think they're as similar sounding or anything like that ? Maybe just my taste though haha thanks anyway man lt 3
It was from the movie The Interview , so yes ... It's definitely not true lol ! But still funny nonetheless :D
I'm not sure , but I think that's what they're going through . They are trying so hard and failing at everything else too !
I'm at day 2 and it's still not over ! Keep going man you can do it !
I watched it because they were making a movie about him and he was in it , so that's why i'm watching this show too ! :D
It's not like he was the only one who got it right ...
I've done it , and they didn t even ask me for my ID or anything like that ... just asked if i had any papers to bring in .. lol !
Nope . I'd go with the noodles and save my money !
I'm glad you like it :D It's a great design and the artist is really talented so far too lt 3
I'm not sure if that is a good thing or bad ... but it certainly isn't an evil thing ! :D
I'm not saying he's bad but his voice sounds so much more robotic than the other guy and it makes me cringe every time i listen too him talk about football ... lol ! :P Edit : spelling error .. sorry folks hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhheeeehee
I'm sure he'll get paid , but I doubt they'd want him on the team if he didn t have any experience with them before joining . He s not that good either ... lololollolo ! :D D: lt 3
I think it was just an old school pocketknife , but I could be wrong ...
I've seen it , but I don't remember him being that bad in the movie ...
I'm going in tomorrow morning ! :D Thanks for your help though man lt 3
I'm sure you can find someone with the same name on ebay or something , but I don't know how much it would cost ... maybe like 20 30 bucks total ! :D
Rocos contract expires in 2018 . He's not going anywhere , but he'll be a free agent after that season if we don't resign him this summer or next year I think ?
I've had it crash once or twice , but I'm not sure what the cause is . It's been a while since my last one crashed though ! :D
I think it's more of an ad . I'm not sure though , maybe the title was misleading or something ...
I think it's more that he wanted a shorter version so his editor could work on editing and not have him do the whole thing in one go ? I dunno ... shrugs
I'm a friend of mine who's in the same boat as you . I'll PM ya some suggestions if your interested , and we can get together sometime soonish ...
I'm not sure if that's a reference or just an awesome name for your dog ... but it sounds like something he'd say in his sleep :D Thanks ! lt 3
You're a good man , u davethepenguin ! You'll be fine ...
It's a bit further than that . It doesn't even reach the main building in time for the fight at all ! I'm not sure if there are any other options though .. :P Edit spelling error lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwwwaaaaaaahhhahahaha
It was a joke , I'm sure you're aware but it wasn't meant to be taken seriously lol !
He was fouled on the shot . It's not an illegal screen if you're going to go up and contest it anyway ...
I have a galaxy s7 edge and it's still pretty slow for me , but I'm on android so maybe that has something to do ? Thanks ! Edit : fixed typo in phone name ...
Like taking your shirt off to reveal you're wearing nothing but underwear ...
I'm on it . Thanks for the heads up , man :D
I think you mean Playoff Harden CP4 , but yeah that would be a good nickname for him too ! :P
I think it's just because he was so excited to be in there that his pupils were dilating , but then again ... cats do this alllll day long ! :D lolololloloooloo lt 3
Because the refs were incompetent .
I'm not judging at all ! :D
I'm not saying it's easy or even safe for him at all I just don't see how he can afford such an expensive house with no job . He must be rich ! ? :P Edit .. edit
I think you mean anabomber , not abominable ... but I'm sure there's some kind of animal that can do better than us humans !
I'm sure it'll be fine , but I'd like to see a new server that's not just vanilla or whatever they call them nowadays ...
I did this once , and it was awesome ! It's like listening in the car when your parents are talking over the radio ...
I think he means that they're both in a similar situation as well ... but I could be wrong about this one ! :D Edit : spelling is hard sometimes lolololoolllll
I think it's more about his views than anything else tbh ... I mean look at how much people love Trump and all but still dislike Macron even if they're not in France anymore ! :P l edit
I agree with you on that one !
I think it's that you're not getting any of your money back from Microsoft for this service ...
I think you mean'extremely ' .
I'm not sure if I agree with that statement but the point remains valid nonetheless !
I'm from South Korea so that's not really surprising to me at all !
Sb , but I'm biased .
You're in for a treat ! He's one if my favorite authors to read about history . His books are so well written that you can't help but love them too much :D Edit spelling error fixed it
I'm not sure what that means . I don't have a couch , but my apartment is pretty small and it's just sitting on the ground in front of me ... ? ! :P Edit : words are hard lolololoolllll
He's not a good coach , but I think his defense has improved significantly since last year and is playing better than before .
I'd say either one . I'm not sure how much he'll be able to throw though so it's a toss up for me personally but that could change depending on the outcome of this game ! :P Edit : spelling error ...
I'm not sure what you mean by that ... I just don't think he's actually serious about defending himself or his family from abuse and neglect ?
I'd take that trade in a heartbeat !
Who is he ! He's a guy . A really good one at that ...
He was on vacation for like 2 weeks so I don't think that would have been enough time in his life before leaving them ... but it could've happened ! :D lul wp Dallas tho ..
You can't , it's a glitch in the game that happens when you're not logged into your account and then log back on to see what happened ! :P
I'd like to see a good game between ISUs and TCU . I think we can both beat them at home if they're not playing us in Norman though ...
I'm sure the US has a lot of people who believe it's not . I know that many Americans think global warming isn't happening because there are no glaciers on Mars anymore ! s
I'm so sorry for your loss of sleep tonight !
I agree with you 100 but it was still an awful call by the refs to not throw that flag ...
Try to open it in a private window and then close that one . That worked for me ! :D
I'm okay with this . I want a rematch in November !
I don't have one , but if you find it let me know . It's pretty interesting to watch !
I think it's a toss up between them but I'd say Rodgers is more consistent and has had better success in the playoffs than Brees ever will have ... so yes ! Edit : spelling error fixed that one lolz .. sorry guys lt 3 u 2 bbzzzzzzz
He's not . He just wanted to be in there and they let him because it wasn't his fault that someone else got stuck inside of them ! s
It's the same thing , but with more heat !
It's a good thing they're not , then ! :D I'm glad you like it though because that was my first thought too haha x3
You're welcome and good luck with your new job search :D I hope you get it done soon enough lt 3
I've been meaning too ! Thanks for reminding me about it :D
It was the way he said it . I'm not sure if that is what you mean , though ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic but I think it's pretty clear that Jaylen is a better shooter than Rozier at the moment ...
You're not supposed too put it there though ? :P
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll . I don't think it's censored , though ...
I slept in my car . I was too tired to drive so it's not like a big deal but still ...
You're not wrong , but I think you should be more specific about that statement ...
They're not speaking English , so no . They just have a translator who speaks their own languages in between games or during breaks from play .
I agree , but I think it's a good idea to have the option for both accounts and not only one of them is allowed in game .
It was pretty loud . I think they were trying to get people out there for some reason ...
I got a Bediles too ! I'm so happy right now :D
I've been playing since the beginning of season 1 . I'm a big fan and would love to watch more matches !
I was just thinking that ! I'm only 25 , but it's still my favorite jersey from back then and one of mine now too haha :D
I'm not sure what I was thinking when i wrote this comment ... but it's true ! :D Thanks guys ..
Melos a good looking dude , he just looks older than life to me ... I think it's that hairline and beard combo though ..
It's a gif , not an image ...
Football is pretty big here , but it's not as much of a thing anymore compared to what we had before . It was always more or less an indoor league though ...
I'm not saying she's a bad character , I just don't like her . She doesn t have the best personality or story to me and that s what makes her so great imo ! :D lt 3
I'm not sure if you're being serious but I think that was a joke .
I'm pretty sure she's going down with her ship , and I don't think anyone will be able too see it coming from that distance ...
I have a 50g one , but I've never used it before so don't know if that's the best size or not !
I think so . It's not too hard to do if you have the right gear and know how long your legs are going for !
I'm with you on that one , I just don't see how anyone could have predicted this would happen ...
They're just trying out new things for their next big thing that will never happen because it's too expensive or something like this ... I'm sure there are more reasons though .. lolololloloooloo
I think you mean better , but that's just my opinion ... and it is an unpopular one ! :D But yeah she could definitely do with being fired up about something else though .. lololollolooolooohhahahahaahaaaahhhhaaawwwwwwaaaaaaaaghhhhhhhhheeeeeeelloooooowwewooo
She's the Queen of England and is also an actress who has been in several films with her . She was on The Tudors as well !
They're going for a record breaking season and they'll be fine without LeBron next year either way ...
I'm sure they were all on their way to work when I took this picture !
I'm going for a semester abroad , so that's not an option unfortunately :P But thanks !
I've been doing it for years and never had an issue with mine ... but then again my wife doesn't mind cleaning hers either so that might be why lolololloloooloo
I think you mean Chiefs . They're not even close to being as good of an offense and defense wise , but they have one of the most talented rosters ever assembled ...
I'm not sure what the difference is between that and paying with cash . I've never had an issue at my current place , but it's been awhile since then ! :P Thanks for your input though lt 3
I was waiting for her to get out of there and go back in , but I guess she didn't want that ...
It's not really that big an event if you're in high school or college and don t know about it ... but yeah he did get married to her after all !
I've had that happen to me before . I was so happy when it finally fell apart !
It's a joke ...
I'm not sure . I think it's a good thing that this is happening though because otherwise there would be no reason for me at all ...
KD amp the Thunder ?
I'm pretty certain it's not . I've seen the movie , but that doesn't seem to be what they were going for in their story ...
They're not real men . They don't count , because they are just a figment of your imagination and you can't see them anyway ! s
I'd love to have a copy of those . PM me please ! Thanks in advance :D Edit : Sent via pm and thanks for sharing these with us all lt 3
You can't , you're a fan of both teams and have to pick one or the other !
I think you're in the wrong sub . This is r mildlyinteresting , not r oddlysatisfying or something like that ...
I don t know , it s not like they are a bunch of goofballs or anything ... but yeah that's pretty much what he is about lol !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but that's a great analogy !
I'm not sure if that's what he meant but it sounds like the same thing to me ! Haha :D
I'm going with a right click and drag on my phone , but I'll be sure not too long before it's gone ...
I'm sure they'll be fine , but it would help if we could get a few more people in there and make them feel welcome !
I'm a fan of the look too ! I think that's what they were going for in this one haha :D Thanks man !
I think it was more of a tribute to their own culture and history than anything else , but I could be wrong about this one ...
I'm glad you got a break . Enjoy your weekend , and thanks for posting this thread :D
I'm in the Midwest too , and I've never seen a single person complain about it ! It was pretty mild for us last year though ...
I'm pretty certain that's what it is . I've never seen a starbucks in my life , but this sounds like something someone would say to me if i did ... lol ! :D D: lt 3333c3l33k3333dddyooooooorrrrbbbbyyyeeezzzhhhhhhahahahaahhhaaaaahhhhheeeeeeyoohoooowwwwwwaaaaaaaawwewaaiiinnnnggggghj
I'm pretty sure that is not true at all ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that you think it's cute ... but thank you for the compliment :D lt 3
I'd be happy to take that offer if he doesn't want one haha thanks though man :D and yeah i have been looking at some old ones too lolol
The moon is a sphere and there are no planets in it so ... nothing really important or interesting at all ! s
It's a great song , and I love the way it sounds ! It really is an amazing piece of music to play on guitar or bass ...
I've heard both , but I'm from London so we're used to hearing'highschools'here as well ...
It's a great photo and the view is amazing from there too ... especially if you're in that area of town .
Life's a journey and you'll get there ! Keep it up man !
You're a beast .
He was pretty good today though !
I agree with you on this one ! I'm sure there will be plenty of angry people who have no idea what it means for them and how much money they're losing out ... s
You're not alone there ! That's what makes it so great though :D
I'm sure it's fine for the fish to eat though ... right ? Right guys .. ? Guys I think we're done here !
I thought I was going to have a heart attack when they showed the trailer for tomorrow land and then realized what movie is coming out next ...
Thanks man ! Just let me know when your ready to go :D
I'm not getting it either , but I don t think that s a bad thing to be prepared against ... ?
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun . But he's definitely one that is very , VERY dark and twisted in the comics ...
I'm not sure if that's true or just a myth ... but it sounds like something you'd hear on the radio in an episode of The Twilight Zone ! :D Edit : spelling error fixed
There are some decent mice out now that aren't too expensive and can be had for cheap if you're willing spend money on them !
Han is about 30 years older then Luke and Leia are around the same age as Rey at least according to canon sources .
I think you mean the Disney version of The Lion King .
I think he's going for a 3rd year . He'll be gone after next season though and I don't see him being hired by another team until at least 2018 2019 or later ... maybe sooner ! :D Edit : typo error lolololooololllllooooooowwwwwwoooohhhahahaahahhahahaaaahhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaawwweeeeeeellooooooooooshiiiiiieeeewwwwwwwwhuuuuhgggghjeh
Same here , but it was an event one ...
I'm pretty sure that's the opposite of what he said ... ?
I think it's the best one I've ever seen on this sub , and I'm not even an avid Smugmuggle fan ! :D
It is in New York , but it doesn t have to be a state law violation for the police department s discretion and discretion on how they handle this situation ...
I've been there before and it was great ! Thanks for reminding me to check out their website again ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or just a troll , because that's exactly what happened last year ... and it was still an amazing game !
I'm not sure what that has anything do with the fact I was on a plane for 2 days straight , but okay ...
I'm American and have lived here my whole adult lives ... so yes they do !
He was a vegetarian .
I think you mean that kid was a better shooter than him , and not just because of his dad's shooting skills ...
I think he's been pretty good this season . He has a lot of potential , but I don't see him being the best in Europe anytime soon ... yet ! :D Edit : spelling error fixed now ?
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but if it's the same as your comment then yes , he should definitely be a State ! :D
More aerodynamics in general .
I think it's more that he was an Englishman who lived in Scotland and had to deal with the accent differences between his two countries .
I'm sorry , but that was the best part of that film !
I'm sure you can pull some of the best skins in this game . I've pulled 2 and both were great pulls !
They're legal in California and New York as well !
I think he's just short for his height , but yeah it was pretty funny to see how much of an awkward guy he is in that scene haha ! :D lt 3
I'm pretty sure it's just an illusion created by gravity to make us look bigger than they actually are ...
I think you're confusing this subreddit with r hiphopheads , where the majority is against anything that isn't their favorite song or artist by them .
He's a pretty big deal in the music industry and he was on SNL last year ! He has been doing stand up since like 2006 or something lol ...
You're not alone .
You'd be surprised . He's got the power of an elephant trunk and can run at top speed for hours on end !
I'm a big fan of his too ! I think he's one that could be used as an example for how not all lawyers are bad people in real life ... or something ? lololollolo :D lt 3
That's a good one . It reminds me of the scene from The Big Lebowski where he is trying to get out and gets stuck there for like 10 minutes ...
I think that's the point . He was probably just trying to make a joke and it didn't work out so well for him ...
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think he's actually the most likely candidate for this job atm !
Rikaras been doing well . She's a great wrestler and she has some of her best matches in NXT right now with Asuka as an example for what to expect from them ! :D DDT lt 3333
Hammond's a robot , he can't even do that well in the game ! He'd have to become one of those robots with no personality or anything like it ...
I'm not a good person . But thanks for being nice to me and giving me some advice on how i can improve my self esteem :D lt 3
You can't just ask for a disc and expect them not be stupid enough , right ... ?
I think he's trying out a new program called Snipping Tool . It can do that , and it works ! :D
It's a gif , not an animation ...
That's a lot of money for an action movie ! I'm sure you're happy with that , though ...
Omlette du fromage !
Or the first Matrix film ...
I'm not sure about that , but I know they do in the midwest and Midwest states like Illinois or Indiana ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but I'll take your word as fact and upvote it anyway ! :D Edit : Thanks guys lt 3
Steve's a better version of the original Kage .
I'm not sure what you mean by back up ? Like if i go into my inventory or something ...
I'm sorry , I didn't realize it wasn t until after half time that we were down by 20 and had to go for 2 ...
I'm still waiting for the day when they have a good match on Raw and it's not like that one time where Roman won ... oh wait .. nevermind ! :D D:
I'm not sure if I should be impressed or horrified ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is the top comment ...
It's a great game ! It was free on PSN last year too ... so you could get it cheaper if your friends have ps4s or xbox one s .. ? :D D: dddd lolololloloooloo lt 3
I think it's more about how they're both so good at what they do and are very nice people to each other that you can't really dislike them for their actions ...
I think it's just an expression of stress , not necessarily depression or anything like that ... but I could be wrong about that one too .. :P Edit : spelling error fixed now lolololllll
I think they're both about the same age as Walt is now ... maybe a little younger than Jesse was when he first started working for Saul though .. I dunno ! :P lolololloloopsieepppooopeeoopycoooooooooopiesyup.jpg XD xD lt 3
I think it's a good idea for them not too much of an issue though ... I mean they're already in orbit and all that stuff is pretty big ! :P Edit spelling error fixed .. lol thanks guys lt 3 u 2 bbzzzzzZs
I think it's just that she was being sarcastic and not really trying too hard at all ... I don't know though .. maybe the whole thing is cringeworthy lol ! :D D: lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling . I'll take the latter , but it's a bit of both for my tastes :P
He's a rookie . It is possible to be wrong and still have an impact on your career , especially if you're young enough in this sport ! s
I'm sure you'd be able too ! :D
I'm a little bit of both ... I mean the whole thing is just so weird and random !
He's been playing well . He just needs to get his confidence back up and he'll be fine for the playoffs !
I think you mean upside up ...
I'm with you . It's just a meme , it doesn't mean anything to me anymore ...
I wish ! I'm just an old man who loves to watch his kids play with toys on Christmas morning ...
I'm sure you're not the only one who's been there , but I've never heard of North Korean women being that way ...
I'm not sure about Math but I know a few deaf kids that can't read very good so it's worth looking into ! :D
I'm pretty sure he's just using an iPhone . I've never heard him speak before , but it sounds like something that would be said by someone who has .
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I think the article is talking about how much of a difference in temperature can make , but why ?
It's not that hard to do when you're a teenager and have no responsibilities or work commitments ...
You can't . It's locked to your account and cannot be unlocked until they return their keys or pay for them with cash , which is what happened here ...
I'm pretty sure you're right . It's not like they have to be in the same state as me ... but still !
I'm not sure what I did but it was a lot of noodles and some garlic salt ...
He's from the Netherlands , but I'm not sure if that makes him more dutch or less . He was born in Germany though so maybe it has something to do with nationality ... hmm .. :P Edit : spelling error fixed lolololoolllll
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think that's because people are more aware about their health risks than they were back then ... ?
I m sorry , I didn t mean to do that ! It was just an accident and it wasn't my intention at any point ... but thanks anyway :D lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious , or just a troll ... But that's exactly what I thought when watching this video ! :D
I'm not sure what you mean by'US needs no help from Russia ' ? I think it's pretty clear they're helping them out in a lot of ways ...
I think they're going for the 3D Mario game style , but I could see them doing something like Super Paper Mario or something similar if they wanted too ...
I think that's the only time I've ever seen it , and even then it wasn't really that big . It looked like a small town or something though ... ?
He's a robot , duh ! s
I was thinking more along the lines that they were from The Mist , but I guess you're right ! :D
I'm sure they'll do something with it eventually though right ? It would be cool if they did that for each character . Maybe we can get some more characters from there as well :D Edit : spelling error fix'd
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I hope it's the former , because this is a terrible idea for children ! :P But seriously ... adults are gross to me as well .. lolololllllz lt 3
I'm not married , but she's been doing this for years and is still going strong ! She likes her vegetables fresh from the garden so that they don't get soggy ...
Red delicious is the best , but I think galas are more of an acquired taste than reds .
It wasn't planned at all ... I'm not sure what you're talking about ?
The heat are a good team but they're not going to win any games this year and I don't think that'll happen in the playoffs either way lol ...
I agree . I think it's important to have the community be able and willing , even if they don't want to participate in discussions about what makes them good or bad players ! :D DD DDDd ... wait .. wrong sub ? lolololooolollooohhhahahahaha XD xddddddyyyuuuuhhhhhhhaaaaahhhhheeeeheeheeeeeehaaaaa
The team that has more yellows . If it's a draw then they advance on away goals and vice versa for home games or penalties .
I don t think anyone hates him as much as they hate his team s fans though ...
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but I think it's pretty clear he was being sarcastic ...
I think that's a good rule of thumb !
I'm so jealous ! :D
I think we should just let him play for us until he's ready to be cut , then trade him back when his contract expires or something like that ... ? I dunno .. lol ! :P Edit : grammar error fixed it up hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
I'm sure it's fine , I just don t think they should've been able to do this in such an obvious way ...
I'm sorry for him ! : c
You're doing it wrong , you should be singing in your head !
I'm sure he's not the only one . I've been there and it was awful , but that doesn't mean they're all bad !
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I agree 100 on both points !
I'm not sure what you're getting at . Are the people who are saying that Canada is a threat , or just some random guy on Twitter ?
The government , of course ! s
He can't be countered if he's already dead ...
I'd like to see him wear a helmet with his name and number on it , just for funsies !
I'm not sure what they're thinking ... I think it was a joke about how people are saying that if we lose then there will be no more games for us ! :P
I'm not sure if that is what he was trying for , but it certainly seems like a possibility ! I'll have to look into this further ...
Because he was fouled on the shot ? I don't know , but it's not like there wasn t contact at all ...
I'm not worried . I just want a good game on Sunday night , and that's all we have left for this season !
That's what I'm thinking too !
I'd take a kenpachi over akuma any day .
It's not even that bad . It just doesn't have the same charm as it used to , and I'm sure they'll be fine with this one being on Prime Video next year ! :D Edit : spelling error fixed
I'm sure you'd have a lot of trouble getting it off without damaging your hand or arm , though ...
I'm not sure if I can , but it's a good thing we're in this position to be able too !
I think it's more about his contract than anything else honestly ... I don'know why people keep saying that though lol .. It s not like we have any other assets at all right now ! :P Edit spelling error haha sorry guys lt 3 u 2 bbzzzZyhfjrpplplsrsgwrtngggghhhmmnstttm
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but that sounds like something my parents would do ! :D Happy Birthday btw !
He's also done some other stuff , like The Last of Us and the new Star Wars movie . I think he has a lot more potential than we realize ! :D Edit spelling ...
I agree . I think it's just too much of an advantage for one team to have , and not enough on another side .
He's also a great coach and has been to the playoffs more than once in his career , so he can't be that bad of a quarterback either ... right ? Right guys .. ? ! s
It's a common thing in Sweden and Finland as well ! I think it is more of an American thing than anything else though ...
I think that's what happened . He didn't want the teamfight going on too long and then they just stopped fighting because of him being so far behind them all game :P ! xD
He's not bad at all though ... I mean his name isn't Davante Adams so what do ya expect ? He just doesn'have the same level of talent as most CBs in this league .. lolololoolllll ! :D lt 3 u bbz 2k15
I'm sure they're just going to be sold out by the time this thing comes in and people are already getting their hands on them lolololllllzzzzzzzZZZZsSssshhhHhheeeeewwwwwwwOoWooWoooWooooowahhhhhhhh heeeeeyooooooooohoho
I'm not sure if you are being sarcastic or serious ... but thanks ! :D It's a great feeling to be able say that , isn't it ? Haha ..
I'm sure they'll be picking it up , but I don't think he's going to do a whole lot of reporting on it since his sources are all in town and not much else ! :P Edit spelling error .. ?
I think you mean 90k , but I'm pretty certain that's a typo and OP meant to say 105K for his degree ...
I don t know if we can trust them to do anything about NK or China joining us though ..
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
It's a bit of an odd one , but I think it was probably just some people from there .
He's probably thinking about how much money his dad made from the show and what it would be like if they had him on as an extra or something ...
I'm Canadian and that's exactly what he said !
I'm sure they'll be back with more than one page of pictures and videos , though ...
I think it is more that they are not getting any help from their bigs and can't get to a shot at all , which I'm okay with though ...
I got one from my first pull of this banner and it was Nat 4 ... so maybe they're going back down again soon :P
I think he means that they're not really a thing , but rather an event or something like this is happening on one particular day in the year ...
What's a potato , cousin of a chicken .
I've been riding on that section for years , and never once had a problem with traffic or anything like that ! It's great !
I'm not your son ! I don t have kids yet ... but you can call me whatever you want if you'd like :P
I think you mean the World Cup , not this tournament ...
I do . I'm a big fan of waving at people and stuff , but not others ! :D
That's what I was thinking ! It looks so much more dangerous than it is , and that's why they do it ... because of all those kids in there with them ? :P lolololloloooloo
I think they got it from their own cap room , not theirs ... but yeah that's pretty bad lol .. I'm sure we'll get better deals in free agency though !
Burritos are delicious ! I'm going to try and get one this weekend ...
You're a good person , I hope you have an amazing life ! :D
It'll be like the US in WW2 , but with less freedom and more fear mongering from both sides of history !
I think they're still a bit of an improvement from last year , but I don't see them being as good this season if we keep playing like this ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but I'll take it either way :D Thanks for the support mate lt 3
I don t know . I m not an OSU fan but he s been pretty good for us so far this year ... maybe we should keep him around until next season starts ! lolololllllzzzuuuuhhhhhhhahahahaahhhaa haaaaahhhhahahaaaaaaa
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but I think it's funny how much money he makes compared with other coaches and players on this list ...
It's not that bad if you use a browser with an adblocker or something like uBlock Origin . It just takes some time to load and refresh ads .
I'm a tall guy and my wife's not even taller than me , so ... yeah ?
I'm not sure what you mean ? I don't think it would be an issue if they were all in favour of this law ... right guys .. s
I'm in a league called The League of Legends , it's pretty fun and you can play with other people from your area ! It is very competitive though ...
I think it's his brother , but I could be wrong ...
The only thing that can stop the bothan is a good blaster .
I'd love a Paper Mario sequel to the DS one ! That was my favorite game of all time and it's still fun now with modern graphics ...
He was a spy . He wanted to get rid of his brother and save him from death by being captured , but then they died in battle against each other ! s
It's been around since at least 2001 ... and probably longer than that if you count all of its sequels !
I'm not sure what you mean by this , but I think the point is that there's no need for them to be paid in order of importance ... ?
I don t think that would work because it s a different time period than what we see in the show now ... I mean like before the rebellion or something ..
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , so ... what's your favorite part of KH3 ?
I think it's a good idea to post more videos like that . It looks cool and makes me want some new content in my life haha :D Thanks again man lt 3
I think it was the same price as their other models , but I'm not sure if they had any sales for them or anything like that ... ?
He's not allowed to fast . He has a medical condition that prevents him from eating and drinking , so it would be very difficult if he did this in his free time ...
I'd rather have the car I want , but not one that's going to be worth more than my money in 20 years time ! :P But yeah it would probably work out better for me .. lololollolo
I think they're talking about qualifying , which is what I was referring to when saying that there's no way he could have been faster than Hamilton had he pitted earlier ... ? ! s Edit : grammar
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but that's a pretty good point and one of the reasons why we don't get as much corn in general ...
I think the best parts are in that last picture , but yeah I agree with you on everything else !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take your word for it because the first one is probably true ...
Uncle Julio's is the best . I've never had a bad meal there , and they have great wings !
Smash Scramble !
I think it's because he was a Cowboy for the longest time , and his brother is from Minnesota so they're both in that family tree of being a cowboy fan ! :P lololollolo
I did it with my CSP . No issues at all , and I got the bonus immediately !
You can get it covered by your employer for free or at least they did when I was working there in the 90s and early 2000 ' s ...
I've never seen a beagle do that , but I have heard it's very common in the wild and is not something to worry about ! Good luck OP :D lt 3
I think it's a vegan restaurant , but I could be wrong !
Zerglings are a lot more common than you think in high level play though ...
He's back in now ! He got hurt on his first carry and is questionable with an ankle injury ... hopefully it isn t serious though ..
Because they're not in prison , but on a list of countries that are currently under investigation by US intelligence agencies ...
I think it should just be the name of an event , like when you get to play in a tournament or something and win some prizes for your team ...
I'm still here ! :D
He's a big guy and has been in the NFL for years ... He was probably just getting ready before going out there on that last drive lol !
A poem is written by the same person who wrote it ... if they rhyme and have no rhythm then its not poetry !
I think it's more like 2 years and he'll be out of prison by the time his trial starts next year ... or at least that was my understanding from reading about him .. ? ! :P Edit spelling error lolololoolllllzzzzzZZZZsSssshhhHhheeeeerrrrrrhhhhhhhhHHhrgghjkLmEwGgggsBdYyFnKfVbDxNvUu
I'm sure there's a lot more than just revenge . There could be some good ones too though ...
He called out the refs .
You're doing the right thing , friendo :D
I'm sure they'll find a way ...
He's a business man . He knows how to make money and he has the best words for it all ! s
I think he was just a little too excited to be in the preview . He's not dead , but I'm sure it would've been cool if they showed him dieing at some point ... ? ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed that one up lolololoolllllooooooowwwwwwoooohhhahahaahahhhaaawwaaaahhhhhhhhheeeeeeellooooooooooolaaaaaaaayyyyeeehuhuuhuuughuaahhhue
I saw it ! :D
I have one and I'm not even sure what it's supposed too be . It looks like the same thing as my old iPhone , but with more features ?
I'm sure you'll be fine , but I'd like to remind him that it's not a good idea for anyone else in this thread if they do ! :P
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it's a joke about how people in Cali are so much more liberal than other places ... ? Idk though lol ! :P Edit : spelling error hahaahahaahahhhaa .. haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
I'm not sure if that's an insult or just a reference to something ... but it sounds like a great movie !
He's not that great . He was pretty average last year , so it would be nice to have him back for the playoffs if we can get there with our defense though ... maybe ! :D Edit spelling error .. lolololoolloliogloooooohhhahahahaahhhaaawwwwwwaaaaaahhhhhhhhaaallloooowwaaaattttuuuuhgghjkdzfkkbbbbyyyyeeeewoooshiiiii
I think he's just trying to get a good deal on it , and that's all I can see here ...
I think he meant quali not q1 lol ...
He's not rich though ...
I think you're right , but I'm not sure how much that matters to the point at hand ...
I'm from there ! It's a beautiful place ... but not so much for me right now haha ..
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ... I'll take either one ! :D
Marcelo is Brazilian , not Portuguese ...
I loved that movie . It's a shame it didn't get more attention in theaters or something like that ..
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but it's spelled'tuckered out'in the UK .
I'm going to go with ramen , but you should try it out and see what works for ya !
I think you mean 3 .
I m sorry for your loss !
I'm sorry for your loss ... but you're not alone !
I'm not even going to bother . I'll just go back and watch it on my TV instead , thanks ! :D Edit : Oh god ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but this is a good idea .
I'm going to the midnight showing . It's gonna be a good one , man ...
I'm sorry to hear that , but I think you're right about it being awful ! It's just not my favorite kind of pie :P But still delicious nonetheless ?
I'm a fan of this idea !
I don't know , but you should probably check your messages . It's a spam account that just posts random things in the shower thoughts section of their profile page ...
I'm not sure what you're talking about , but I have a friend who has over 100,000 and he's still in bronze ...
I think it's more of an ego thing . He doesn't want to be on IR , but if you're injured and don t play then your career is over for him anyway ... right guys .. Right ! srslyhahaahhaahahaaaahhhheeeeeeelllollllleeeerrrrrdddooooooonnnnnggggghhhhhhhh
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is the top comment , but it's definitely a good movie and deserves more attention than it gets here in r movies .. lol :P Edit : spelling error fixed hahaahahaahahhhaa
I'm a simple man , I see an opportunity for profit ... And there it goes .
I'd buy that for a dollar !
I think he means the building inspector is a contractor and they're supposed to be able too make repairs on their own time ? Not like it's an official job or anything ... lol !
My grandmother is 60 and she's a great grandma ! She was the best Grandma I've ever had , but that doesn't mean anything to me now does it ?
It's the best way to get people who don't want it , and are willing for change . It works in other countries too though ...
I'd laugh so hard . I'm sure he'll get picked for it , but not by us ! :D
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but that's a good way of putting it .
I'm sure you'll find a way to make it work , but I don t think there s any chance we ll ever get rid off this system in our current state ... yet ! :P
I don't know about the rest of them but my planet is Uranus !
I'm hoping they'll do a port . It'd make sense since there are already so many games that have been ported from PC and XB1 , especially if you're into competitive shooters like Overwatch or TF2 ... ? :P Edit : Spelling error lolololoooloo
I'm sure he's a great guy , but I don't think it would have been possible to get him in shape without some serious help from coaches or trainers ...
I think you're confusing incompetence with stupidity ...
I agree , but I think he's a bit too good to be in this game atm ...
It's always been a 3 hour show . It'll be longer now that they're doing more matches and have had to cut some stuff out of their schedule for RawithSDLive events etc ...
I think he's a pretty cool guy and I like him in general but yeah ...
I think it's confirmed for 2017 .
I think it's a good sign that he is going to be able get back up . He has been doing this for years and I'm sure his legs are tired ! :D lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun ... but I think that was the joke in this case :P Edit : spelling and grammar are hard ! Haha sorry guys ..
I think it was more of an accidental hit than anything else , but yeah that's not really how you're supposed to tackle someone in this situation ...
I'm sure you could find a few at your local coin shop for cheap !
I'm sure he'll be able to do that with his omnipotent power of will ! s
I don't know about that ... Lebron has been playing like trash all series long ..
I love both of those games too :D
I've got a few machines that are running NT 4.0 , but they're all Windows 7 or later ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll . Either way it's funny and makes me laugh every time !
Because they're cute and delicious ! :D I'm not sure if that's the reason , but it makes sense to me at least ...
I've never heard anything about this movie , but if you like scifi and horror movies check out The Devil Dolls by David Mamet ! It's also on Netflix Instant Video right now ...
Squawk ! Squawks are delicious and tasty but they're not exactly what OP wants to eat at dinner time :P
Nixon is the best president ever , but he's not a good one either !
I think that's what I'm going to have to try . Thanks for your input ! :D
I'm sure you guys are enjoying it ! I just don't think we're ready yet ... but that's okay because this game isn t over until its done lolololloloooloo
I don't want people who are too stupid or lazy , but I do think that they should be treated as such and have their rights respected by society in general ... ?
I'm pretty sure it's legal to sell them , but you have a lot more than one person who can buy and use your stuff for profit ...
I have no idea what you're talking about but it sounds like something the police might want us all knowing !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic but I think it's pretty obvious he is joking about how much money they spent on this game and their servers lololollolo ! XD xDxdxdxcusemehahahahaahhaaaaahhhheeeeeeheeheeeehhhhhhhh :P
I thought it's a reference to his ability that he can't be damaged by anything but himself , so he has no way of getting out from under him ? Or am I thinking wrong ... lol .. :P Edit !
I like the colouring for that map . I think it looks really cool !
Captain Marvel , obviously ! s
I think you're missing the point of this thread ...
Because it looks cool and you can use it for a lot more than just gaming ! :D
Ah , I see now that they're not all over the place then :P Well done on your city though and good luck with future projects !
Because it's just an expensive toy and they're trying to make money off of you buying one ? I don't think that makes sense at all ...
It was actually really tasty ! I'm not sure why though ... maybe because they were so small ? But still delicious nonetheless lol :D
I think you're right , I'm not sure though ...
That's awesome ! What kind of stuff did she do ?
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll but I think that was actually pretty funny lololollolo !
It's a good way to show that they're not actually dead , but rather just in shock and disbelief at what happened .
I think he'll be remembered more for his presidency than anything else , but I agree that it will probably get him a lot of hate mail and death threats from people who dislike Trump ... lol ! :P lt 3 u bbzkitties 2u2c3r4s1e5d8a7f9g6x0hqwjn
I'm not sure if you're serious or just really high on the bulls but he's been pretty good for us in his limited minutes and is only 24 years old !
I'm a Pats fan , but I don't think anyone hates us . We're just not good enough to be in that conversation with the other teams we play against ... yet ! :P Edit spelling error fixed it's funny now lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwww
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry at this ...
He's fluent . He speaks English and Spanish fluently at least once a week on stream .
I was there , it's one of my favorite games ever !
I was thinking more along the lines if they were going for a spider man look then maybe it would be better to have him as an actual superhero instead ? Idk ... shrugs I guess .. lol ! :P hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhheeeeheeaaaaaaaaghhhhhhhh
I think he means that they will be playing against each other in a tournament , not necessarily on stage at worlds ... but I could see how it might work out ! :D edit .. lolz xdxdxdd
It's not like they're going to be doing anything else for years after that anyway ...
Yes , it's their home jersey . They're playing in a friendly against Paraguay tomorrow so they'll be using this one for sure !
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic . But it's true ...
He's a good guy . He just doesn't want to be there anymore , and he wants the spotlight on him now that his life is over with drug charges pending against him ...
I'm a Giants fan so yes !
Because they're not relevant to this subreddit and we don't want them here , so why should anyone care about it at all ! s
I've been playing for a few hours and I'm still not sure what you're talking about ... ? What do they even mean by that ? ! : O EDIT : Nevermind found out lol thanks guys lt 3
Phil got the first of his own in game 5 against us last year when he was on the ice for the goal and scored it himself !
I think it's more likely that Charlotte trades him for a pick or two , but I don't know if he'll be traded to the Lakers in this scenario either way ... ? ! lolololllll
I'm pretty sure that's what happened , but I don't know how to prove it because there is no proof of anything in my post history ... ? :P Edit : spelling ! D: lt 3
I'm going for the high ground ! I have no idea what's happening , but it looks like fun ...
I was so disappointed when they removed the ability to shoot through walls . It's a shame really because it made me feel like an actual zombie instead of just being invisible ... :P Edit spelling error ..
It's not that bad , I think Lady In The Water was great and had an amazing soundtrack too !
He fell , but I think the bullet hit him on top of a building and bounced off the ground into an open field ... so it's not like they were shooting at each other ! s
I'm sorry for your loss , but I hope you're doing better now ! lt 3 hugs and kisses from a stranger on the internet ...
It's real , but it sounds like a mix of some other songs that were used in this video . I think they're just trying to get people hyped for their new album ! :P Edit : spelling error ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think that's a pretty good point to make about this whole thing ...
It will probably just get more popular and people won't care about it anymore , but I'm not sure if they'll do anything with the idea or whatnot ... ? :P Edit spelling ! D: D DD
I was thinking the same thing ! I'm not sure why but it's definitely destiny inspired lol :P Thanks for your input though man appreciate you taking time out of my day haha lt 3333
I think they're all dead now , but that's a good point !
I'm not sure what you're trying to say here ... but I think it's pretty clear he was talking about the US and Russia ?
I think he'll be fine with us as long as they don t overpay him like that guy did to Melo in NY and Boston ...
I think it's a good idea to have some humor in this film , but I don't know if they could pull off an 80 ' s style comedy with all of these characters ... yet ? ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolololoolllll
I didn't expect him , but I'm not surprised he did it at all considering his age . He's a great player with potential though !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I hope this is sarcasm , because otherwise ... well .. yeah ?
That's awesome , what kind did you get ?
I'm getting around 6 hours of SOT on my Note 4 , and that's with a moderate usage pattern .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've never seen a Shaman with that talent on them ...
I'm not sure if it's possible for me , but she is still my favorite celebrity of all time ! She just looks like an angel now though lolololllll :D lt 3
I think it's more likely the writers just didn't want to write a character who was already dead and had no reason for being alive in the first place ... ? I dunno , maybe ! shrugs
I think that's a lot of money . I'm sure he'll be able to afford his own lawyer and everything , but still ...
You'd have no idea what was going on and it wouldn't matter because the table is always moving so there's nothing stopping them from playing anyway ! s
Miami has a lot of talent but they're not very well coached and their defense isn't that great either so I'd say it's pretty even .
A large titanosaurus is the only thing that could make me want this game more than anything else in existence ...
You're not wrong ... But you can't say he's better because of his size and speed alone ! He has to be able catch everything thrown at him too .. right ? Right guys lolololllllz :D D: lt 3
I got a grey one as well . It's so much better than my black white color scheme :D
It's not a ban on faces but rather the use of masks as an excuse to be more open about their identity and or religion etc ...
It's not terrible , but definitely has its moments that are just too much for me to handle at times ...
I'm not sure . I think it's real but the mods have been deleting all my posts and comments for some reason ...
She's a heel , she doesn t have to be that way ... but I agree with you on the walking around part lol ! She s just so annoying in general though .. :P hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhaaaaaaa
It feels longer than most . It has a very long range , but I think that makes up for its shortness by being so beautiful and uplifting ! :D lt 3
I'm not really into the genre , but I loved The Big Lebowski ! It's one of my favorite movies ever made ...
He's a beast . He was the best player on our team last year and he is still playing at an elite level today !
I'm sure you can find one . I've been playing on the official servers for years and never had any problems with lag or anything that wasn't caused by my internet connection ... :P !
Hulu is great ! It's free with Prime if you have prime or a cable subscription .
Can u pm me too please . Thanks in advance :D lt 3
I'd watch that !
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote you for that comment ...
That's what I was thinking . It'd be nice if they gave us a little bit more variety in our talents , but that seems like it'll never happen ... ever ! :P
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've heard that's what people do in order to play online games on their PS4s and PC's ?
You could always use the same kind as you would with any other pimple popping procedure ... but yeah , if your worried about infections just go for it ! Good luck :D lt 3
I think it's a good thing . She was annoying and I don't want people thinking we're all like this because of our names ! :P
I'm not sure what the difference is between a girl who likes food and one whose parents are allergic or something like that ... but okay ! :D Thanks for your concern though lt 3
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this is the first time anyone has ever said something like this ...
I'm sorry , but it's not an actual story from the author of this post ... It was just something he wrote on his phone and posted to Facebook . Sorry for any confusion ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed that one up .. lolz ? xD lt 3 u bbbyyyy
He clearly got back into the endzone before getting knocked down by a defender , but I don t think it s indisputable that he didn t get there until after contact with his own teammate ... ? ! Edit : spelling error fixed .. thanks guys lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwwwweweelldddeeerrrrrpppfftttttttuuuuppsss
That's so sad ! It must be hard , but you're doing it right and that makes me happy for some reason ...
I've never heard that before ... TIL .. Thanks for sharing OP's story with us all though haha lt 3
I'm not paying for it , but if someone is going through my history and they're interested in the program then that's what will happen ...
It looks like an old man to me , but I could be wrong !
I don't think so but I'm sure there are plenty more things in life where using an incorrect term doesn t make sense to me as well !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but the movie was based on a true story so there are historical inaccuracies ? What do they think of this film then ! s
I'm not really bothered by it but the fact that they're so big is annoying to me too !
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ... I'll go with both !
You should , it's a good thing you're not in charge of anything ! s
I'm Russian and I've never heard of it . It's not that unusual , but the fact is we have a lot more than just one language in our government ...
I did , but it's still a good thing to do in case someone else is going through with something like that ...
It's a joke about the fact he was in jail and had to be released because of his mental illness . It wasn't meant as an insult or anything like that ! :P
I'm sure there is plenty of room for improvement in the game , but I don t think it s something you can just throw out as an excuse to not hire people anymore ... ? ! :P Edit spelling error .. lolololoolllll
I'm sure they will , but I don t think that s the reason why he was banned from playing in Qatar for life ...
I'm not sure if that is true or just the way it works in Germany and Austria ... but I'll take your word for it ! Thanks anyway :D
I think that's because they're both in a different order from each other on my screen :P I'm not sure though ! Thanks for pointing this out to me anyway lt 3
I'm in the same boat . I'll be at my desk all day , but it's not like there are any other options that will give me a good time anyway ! :P
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but that's a great idea !
I think you're on to something . I'm going with this theory ! :D
I think it's more that they're not playing well . They've been getting better but still have some issues with defense , especially on offense when Kyrie is out there ...
I think he is a good coach but I also like him as an owner and player so it doesn t bother me too much to dislike his decisions sometimes lol ! :P hahaahahaahahhhaa ... haaaaahhh ..
I think they are trying really hard not too ...
I agree , but I think it's more about how much money he has and what his parents are doing with him than anything else ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious , but I think that's just a codex thing and they don't have primarchs in their own army books yet ? Or am i wrong there ... Edit : spelling ..
Because that's what you do when your car is stolen .
I thought he was pretty good , but I didn't think it fit the tone of the movie very well at all ...
I'm not sure what you're getting at , but it doesn't make sense to me either way ...
I'm sorry for the inconvenience !
Because the game is over . They can't do anything right now , and it's not like CLG has a lot of time to prepare for this match up either ...
I'm 29 with 3 divorcees ! We're all the same person though so we can't be that different from each other :P
I've never had a problem with that , but I'm sure it's not just because of my age and how much time spent in Germany over the years ! :P lololollolo
I think it's more of an attitude thing than anything else ... I'm not hating him at all but his matches are usually pretty good and entertaining for me personally ! :D DDT lt 3
You are now a moderator at r TheSinthistheFury !
I'm rooting for Portugal , but I think England will win this one !
I'm not sure , but I think it's a good idea . It would be nice if they could get some help from people who have been through this before ...
I'm not saying they're all better , but I'd say that Gurleys ceiling would be higher in this league because of his size alone ...
I'm not sure if you're serious but I think it's a joke about how she was in love with Moira and wanted to be with her more than anything else ...
I mean they lost to a team that had the worst record in LCS history and got stomped by TSM ... so yeah it wasn't really surprising at all lol .. sry for bad joke xD ! XD lt 3
You can still do that , but you have a chance of getting kicked out if it's an emergency call or something like this ...
I was thinking the same thing , but I think he's just a little too busy with his own business and not enough time for this kind of stuff ...
I used a custom made one from my local shop , but I think it's called'Catnip'or something like that ! It was about 10 for all four parts and materials :D Thanks ! lt 3
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but I think it's a good thing that this happened in Saudi Arabia because of their human rights record ... ? ! s Edit : spelling error fixed .. Thanks for pointing out my mistake lolz lt 3 u bbbyyyyyshhhiiiiiisssss
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll . Either way I like the optimism !
I'm in , but only if it's an Ogre with no arms ...
I don't think so , but I'm not sure what the deal is with that particular group of people ...
I think it's more of an Eldrazi than anything else , but yeah I agree that it should be scary !
He's not a good guy . He'll be back in the next season or two , but I don't think it will happen for awhile now that he is gone from this show ! :D lt 3
I think it was more of a reference than anything else , but yeah ...
I'm sure he's just joking around , but I think it was more of an act than anything else ...
I think it's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski , but I'm not sure what exactly he said in this clip ...
I've never heard of it but now you mention it ... It's on Netflix ! Thanks for reminding me about this movie :D
I think he is just a bit more aggressive . He has the same amount of damage but with less utility and mobility , so that makes him feel stronger to play against . :P !
RemindMe ! 3 Days Donation for r millionairemakers
I'm sure they'll get there eventually . I just hope we don't have another war on drugs like Mexico did with their drug laws and cartels ... or something similar .. ? ! s
I think it's because they're not official yet , but there are a few of them on r soccerstreams and other places that have been posted here before ...
You can't . They're not allowed in the stadium , and they don t have a TV or radio signal either so you ll need an adult s phone number for that one !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but I think that's what he was going for ...
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by that ... ?
I'm not sure if it's possible to get more than one slot per person but I'll try my best :D Ign is Jaxx 7
I'm sure they would have no problem with that ...
Fortnites are not free , they cost money to make them so you can't just buy the game for yourself without paying real life cash or something like that ... ? ! :P
I'm not sure if you're serious , but that's a great idea !
I've been playing it for years and I'm still not sure if its worth the money or not ... but i'll keep my eyes open ! Thanks man , appreciate that :D lt 3 u2
I'm sure they were just trying to make a profit on their new shiny green power plants ! s
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this was my first thought .
He's been great , but I think it was more about his work rate than anything else . He is a very good footballer though !
I'm from the Bronx , and my dad is a teacher in NYC ... so it's not that far off ! :D
I think he's just a really big fan of the show and wanted to be in on all this action ! :D I'm not sure though ... maybe you're right lolololoolllll XD xdxdxddxxdxcvxyzzzzzztsss
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that the guy who did it is now dead and gone , but at least he's done something good for humanity ! s
It's not like she can't get pregnant , right ? I mean ... you know what they say about women who don t have kids ! :P
I think it's more like a spectrum where there are different types and levels to be attracted too . It doesn t have anything in common with bisexuals though ...
They excel in their ability to make a joke out of anything , even if it is not funny or clever enough for them ...
I thought they had some kind of weird magic trick going on . I'm not sure why , but this is what happens when you try and do something like that ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote you for this comment ...
I think it's about the same as an IP boost , but you can't buy RP with that money so ...
I'm in . I'll pay for the ticket and food , but not the beer !
I'm not crying , I just want to see a good game !
I'm interested in the results ! Thanks for sharing this with us all and thanks again for your hard work on this project :D lt 3
It's probably because he was trying the same thing with his hand and didn't realize that they were both on their hands , so he just used one of them instead ... ? I dunno .. shrugs
keep goin ' ! :D
I think we're gonna lose to Kentucky . I'm not sure though , but that's what the committee wants us for this year so ... maybe !
I'm sure they're all paid by the state , so it's not like their jobs are in jeopardy or anything ... right ? Right guys .. ? Guys ! s
I think they're all on Netflix now !
I think it's because he was playing on console . I'm sure there are better players out there that can do this with a controller or something similar , though ... ? :P Edit : grammar
I read them all ... I just don t care about karma or anything like it lol .. but yeah i guess you re right on this point ! :P Thanks for your input though man haha lt 3
I think that is what happened with him last year too ... I remember thinking we were going in for his replacement at first then they got rid off him .. sighhh ! :P
We don't . We just get lucky sometimes and make a few extra points in the endzone to win games for us , but that's about it ...
I don't know , but if you find out let me know . Thanks ! :D
Same here ! I've been waiting since launch day ... finally got a chance at the game last night after playing through all 3 episodes in 1 sitting lolololoollooowwwwwwoooooohhh boyyyyeeeaaahhhh
I'm going to go with Fisto , but I think it's a bit too long of an acronym ...
I think he means best overall , but I could be wrong about it being one of them or both lolololoolllll
I thought she looked like a young Sarah Jessica Parker ...
I think he has a lot of respect for sherm but I don't know if there is any animosity between him and talib or even taliban ... maybe just mutual hatred towards crabman .. idk haha ! ha edit :
They're not wearing them . They were just there in spirit , but I'm sure the players are going home and getting their stuff together now that he's gone ! s
You're not wrong ... but I'm sure you'd be better off with an actual brothel than this one ! :P
It's not tinnitis if you're deaf ! :D It sounds more like tinnitits though ...
I'm talking more recently than that though ...
I'm not looking at her right now ... I don't want to be in that situation again ! :P But thanks for the advice anyway lt 3
He'll be a beast , but it will probably come down the middle of his career where we have no one else who is good enough for him at this point in time ... lololollolo ! :D D: lt 3
It is , and the people are much nicer than New Yorkers !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but they are delicious !
I think he's just a little bit too young . He'll be fine , though !
I don't think so ... But you can try out r playitforward if your on iOS or Android ! It's a great app with lots of features :D
I did forget that , but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or bad ...
The one that lost to us .
I'm going to get the pixel , but only if it's waterproof and has good battery life ...
I think the trade is for him and his contract isn't guaranteed so it's not like they're going anywhere with this deal ... but I could see that happening too ! lolololllll ..
I think it's more likely they were trying to get a good deal on their own game rather than getting someone else involved with the project for free money ... ? :D DD DDDd !
It's a good thing they're doing that , because I'm sure there will still plenty more movies like this in future ...
I have been doing this for years , and it's still not enough !
I think it's a good idea . I'm sure she'll be remembered for her time in power , but not as much of an icon or anything like that ...
I'm sure it was a great day for you !
I think he's too old for that role now ... but maybe in the future ? ! :D
She's the best of us all ...
It's not like they're going to be riding him anyway ...
I'm pretty sure the only weapon you can use in Warframe is an axe ...
Schole . He's a legend and he was the best player in his generation at Barca . I'd take him over any of those guys though ...
I'm not sure , but it's probably the same way as when they're done with their job and get to go home for lunch or something like that ...
I would probably have a different personality . I'd just be more aware of my surroundings and what's going on around me in life .
He's averaging like 30 a game this year though ...
I feel you , man ...
I agree with you on that one ! I'm not sure why people are so against it though ? It's just an idea and we can't know what would happen .. right now anyway :P lololollolo lt 3
They're not used to playing against the same team as us and we have no idea what our pressing is going for yet ...
Alan wake is a great game though ! I'm sure you'll enjoy it if your friends are into the genre of horror games and such ...
I'm not American and I've never heard that phrase before ... but it's a good one !
I'm sorry , I hope she's doing well ! lt 3
I think he's retired already , but I'm not sure if it was for the same reason as this one though ...
I'm pretty sure that's what they were going for . I think it worked out well !
I think it's the lighting , I'm not sure either lol ! But that is what happens when you use an LED light source for your screen :p
I'm sure the cost would have been higher if it was an actual convenience store , but I don t think that s what happened here ...
I think he's just tired from the last game and wants a break before his next one starts ... I hope ! :D
I think he finished it . I don't remember him saying anything about a cipher though , so maybe not ... but if you want to believe ! :P
TSM Doublelift ?
It's a great show . I'm surprised you didn't get teary eyed at all ! It was so sad , but hilarious in its own way ...
I'm not sure if that's true , but I've never heard of a state where you can't use the brake on an interstate highway .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but that was a good one ! :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of my username , but I'll take it as an insult and upvote anyway :D Edit : spelling mistake fixed that for ya lt 3
Because it's an offside goal .
I'm not American , but I did get one of those messages from my congressman yesterday ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it's a joke ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this cat has been adopted , but it's still my kitty ! :D lt 3
I was thinking about that too , but then again ... Sheep are pretty chill and friendly animals ! :D
I've never had that happen , but I'm sure they would if there was an actual threat of violence or something like this ...
He's not even mad . He just wants to get paid for this fight so bad it hurts him physically .
up voted u too . thanks
up voted u too . thanks
up voted u too . thanks
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but that's actually pretty funny ! :D
I'm not sure if you are serious or just a troll , but I hope your joking ... because that's hilarious !
I'm from Ireland too ! I've never heard that term before though ... Is there a specific reason for this or just an expression people use when they're talking about poor people living abroad etc .. :P Edit spelling error'd myself up haha xD lt 3
Rakans not bad , just a bit out of meta right now imo ... He's still pretty strong though ! I think the problem here are his team comps ..
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote you ...
I'm not sure if that's supposed to be funny or sad ... I think both are appropriate answers ! :D
Because it was his dad who said that , not him himself ...
Jesus was a Jew ? I thought he had to be Jewish ... s
I've been flying for years and I still have no idea how people do that ... It just seems so easy !
I think they're just trying not to get too excited for a bit , but I agree that's what we've been hearing so far ...
You mean you didn't have a warthog ? ! That's awesome man ... that was my first guitar too ..
I'm pretty sure that one is a joke though ... I mean he has to be joking right ? ! s
I think it's a reference to an episode of The Simpsons where Homer gets his first car .
I've never played him but he's definitely one to watch out for in solo queue if you're not playing with friends or family .
I thought that was a bit odd too . I think he's just trying not get his head in the way or something ?
I'm not sure if I want that or a blowout win against LSU ...
I'm going for the same thing , but with my new phone and tablet instead of an old iPhone ...
I'm pretty sure that would be considered suicide by cop .
I think you mean B1G , but I agree with your sentiment nonetheless !
You're not sorry ? ! You should be ashamed of yourself ...
I think it's a good idea , but I don't know if they'll let us see what happens when we do ...
You must be new here ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that you're right about this ... but it's definitely a possibility !
Same here . I'm still playing through the story , but this is one thing that really got me hooked !
He's also got the same haircut that Jon jones had when they fought at UFC 200 ...
It's a baby hippo . It was born in the middle east , so it has to be some sorta hybrid between an animal and human being ... I think that makes sense ! :D DDDdddeepsss
I'm not a fan of either , but I can see why some would find them funny and others wouldn t ...
I think so . He was in motion and had control of his arm before going out to touch it .
He's also in The League .
We'll take them off your hands for you ! We're just trying to get a good draft pick , but we can't afford that right now ...
I've never heard of that town before either ! But yeah ... It's a little more rural than the other two cities in my list haha :P
I'm not concerned . I just want to know what the best way is for me and my family in terms of birth rates are going down or up due to immigration . Thanks !
I think it was , but they were still sponsored by the team . They had a sponsor logo above the number of sponsorships and everything else that came after then ...
That's what I do , but it doesn't work if there are only two ingredients in a recipe ! :P
I'm with you on this one ...
It was never meant to have been written . It is just an idea that people had and wanted to use as they see fit , but not necessarily for their own benefit or anything ...
I think he's just a little bit of both , but I'm not sure how much more than that ...
I would love that ! Thanks so much for the offer , but it's not really what i'm looking to do right now :P thanks though and good luck with your project anyway lt 3
I think it's a good idea . I don t want players getting hurt or anything like that , but if someone is going down and gets knocked over ... well then yeah ..
Oh , okay ! Thanks for clearing up my confusion then :D That's a relief haha ...
They were pretty good in qualifying , though .
You can't . It's a PvP world , and you're not allowed in the wilderness for that reason alone ! :P
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making a joke ... but I like it !
I'm going to try and get some more info on this , but I don't think so ... sorry ! : c
I'm sorry for your loss !
I'm not sure what you're trying to say here ... but it's a good one ! :D
I'm not sure what your point is , but I'll take it as a compliment to Russia's performance at the WC ! :D
I loved that movie . I was so sad when it ended , and then they made another one ! It's like an extended version of Jumanjiji ... except worse lolololoolllll
I think it's been fixed now , but the protests were always a bit of an issue for me anyway ...
Because they're not a good team and are going to lose this year , duh ! s
I agree , but I think the point is that it's not an option for officers who are already on the force and want out of there ASAP ... ?
Or the new one that's being built in Austin ...
I'm not sure I follow your question but it seems like he'd be more interested than most people would think about fighting someone who was already injured and out for months .. lol ! :P hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhheeeeheeaaaaghhhhhhhhaaaaaah
I'm in Texas and have unlimited for 30 days at a time with AT amp T U verse . It is not that bad but it isn t great either lolololoolllll ! :D DD lt 3333333333 33 3333333 3 0.5 MB s
Im not ur friend , buddy !
You're not alone , friend !
I'm pretty sure they're just hired to be there for a few days and then back out when it gets cold enough outside .
I'd pay for that !
I think that's a good point . I wonder if they're just for the sake or purpose , though ...
Needs less politics and more memes !
I'm pretty sure he's going to win a ring with you guys next year ... I think it'll happen eventually though !
The girls become the boys , but they're all dead now because of that one guy who got shot by his own gun while he was trying out for school !
I did forget portal . I'll add it in now ! Thanks for the reminder :D EDIT : Added to list of games that are not on sale anymore ... sorry about this !
I'm sure it's a combination of both . I've seen some videos on youtube that show people doing the same thing and getting paid in cash or something like that ...
I'm sure he'll be fine , but it's still a good reminder that you should never fly with your eyes closed and ears on the ground ! :D Good luck ! lt 3
I have a few more , but I'm not sure if they're all in the same place ...
I'd be interested in this as well !
I'm picturing a buncha people with guns and explosions , but no one is actually there to shoot anyone ... so it's just like real life ?
And they got to play against SKT T1 again ! :D
I think it was more than 2 , but yeah that's a pretty big difference too lol !
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this is the first time someone has ever used a phrase from my favorite show ! :D Thanks for sharing ! lt 3
I think it's more that they don't know who he is . He was a big part of the Attitude Era for me so I'm used to him being there too ! lol ...
TL vs . ROX is going on now , if you want a good game watch it ! :D
You're still the best son of all time though ...
I'm not sure if you're serious , but the warframes are actually pretty good . They have a decent amount in common with each other as well ! :D
I am also dead , but not for long !
I'm sure it's a good thing , but I don't think the people who own them are going to be happy about this either ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote you ...
I'm not your father ... I don't know what you're talking about ..
He was good last year too . He just got hurt early on , but I think it'll be fine now that the season has started to heal up .
I think that would have been too much of an insult to the dead , especially since there are so many other people in their family who died during the war ...
They were chanting it at the beginning of every match and then they stopped after he got eliminated from the rumble ... so no chants for him tonight either way lol ! :D DDT
I'm not sure if this is a joke or just an ignorant statement ... but I'll take it either way ! :D
I think it's a good thing that we're not playing . I'd rather have an exciting match than watch someone who is just trying their best for 90 minutes and then fail miserably ! :P ... wait .. wrong sport ? lolololooololllllooohhhahahahaahhhaaaaahhhhhhhh haaaaaaalrightyeeeeeaaaayyyeeeyoooooowwwwwwooooshiiiiiieeeewwweelloooooooooyouuuuuhhhhh
I'm in Florida and I've had snow for about 3 days now , but not much more than usual ...
I'm sorry for your loss ... but at least we got one thing right in life :P
I'm sorry , I didn't know that . My apologies !
I'm going too ! We should meet up and watch some games together , or something like that ... ? :D
Yes please ! I'd love to see it in its original format and quality . Thanks for sharing this with us all :D
I've been using this for years , works great ! I'm not sure why it's so hard to find though ...
I'm still mad about the game last week , but I'll take it !
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote you for this comment ... but it made me laugh , and that makes two people in the world ! :D Thanks ! lt 3 George Costanzas awesome character too though .. lolololoolllllooooooooloooohhhahahaahahhhaaawwwwwwwhaaat ? haaaaaaaaalrighty thennnnnggggghhhhhhhhheeeeeeelloooooooooowwweeeelp
I'm sure it's a lot more than that , but I think the point is still valid regardless of age or gender .
I'm going with upvotes , because I think it looks cool and is a good idea ! :D Thanks so much though lt 3
I'd go to the one in the back of the building . It's like an old school diner with some nice decor and good food , but it doesn't look very fancy ... yet ! :P Edit spelling error ..
I'm sure you're right about this one ... but what if we just let them go ? What would be left for us then ! s
You're not alone . I'm a senior and it's still pretty creepy to me that they have their own personal camera on them , even if its just for pictures of themselves ... shudder ! lolololllll
I think that's a reference to something else , but yeah you're right about this being an homage and not actually referencing anything specific in particular lol ! :P But still good point nonetheless haha .. XD lt 3
I think you mean worse then Joe Lombardi , but I agree with your sentiment nonetheless !
Because some students have to go through this and others dont ...
I'm in the same boat . I've been playing since beta and have only gotten gold once , but it was a while ago so maybe that's why ? :P
I'm not blaming anyone , I was just saying that it is possible to be both the victims and the perpetrators at times ...
No , but if Yankees beat Red Sox in a 7 game series then yes . If Yanks sweep them both it's still possible for us to get the wild card spot though ! :D Edit spelling ...
I think you mean 3 ...
Roma has had a few chances but they've just missed the target . Barcelona are playing well though !
He was in a group with Froome and Contador . He didn't want to be there for the last few minutes of the race , so he gave it back after that .
Or both !
Glaz has a shotgun .
I'm pretty sure they're just trying too hard , but it's not really fair either way lol ...
I think they'd take that trade in an instant if Kawhi was on the board and they were willing to give up Middletons contract ...
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
It was a joke ... I'm not sure why you're being downvoted for it though ?
I think it's more of an issue with the way he was carrying him , rather than his size or weight . I'm sure there are other reasons too though ! :D lt 3
I think he's talking about the team not him lol ... but I agree that this is going to be fun ! :D
You can't . That would be too easy , and it wouldn t work out well in the long run if they did that to their own people s lives ! :P PPPpLlleeeeZzzztYyyyZZsTmEeeeehNnOooD :d UwSgKqH 8u9xQc4v7k5b6a3r0W xddf 1
I think it's a good sign that they're moving forward with their plans , but I'm not sure if this means anything for them or what will happen next season ... ? ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolololoolllll
It does ... It just isn t as good at connecting to wifi or bluetooth devices because of its lack on USB C ports and WiFi capabilities ..
I think it's safe to say that the show is going through some changes and they're trying out new things for him in order of importance right now ...
Because that's not how science works ...
I'll take the chip . I'm not sure what you're offering though ...
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ...
I'm pretty sure that's what they're doing now ...
I'm sure they'll be in episode 2 . I hope so !
I think it's more that there are a lot less than expected . I'm sure most people would be happy to see them go , but not everyone is going for this one guy .. ? ! lolololllzzzzzzzZZZzzzz zzzzzz Zizzo
That would be cool , but I think it's too much of an inconvenience for the player and not enough fun for everyone else :P
I'm not really into listening , so no need for me to listen on my phone or computer . But thanks ! :D
I have a spider in my living room . It's huge and it lives on the ceiling above me , so I can't even see him ! He is like 6 feet tall though ...
I'm from Texas so it's not that bad for us either ! But yeah they're pretty annoying to read on a phone screen haha :P
I'm from Sweden and we have a similar system to that as well ! It's great for getting around town though because you can just walk everywhere without worrying about traffic or anything ...
RemindMe ! One Year
I'm having this exact same problem , I've tried everything but nothing works ...
I'm sure she's not . She just doesn't have the same kind of personality as me , and I don t think that s what you want from someone who looks like an elf ... lolololloloooloo
Thanks , I'll send you a message .
I think that was the first time I ever saw him win in MMA and it wasn't even close to being competitive either way lol ...
I'm not sure if I can do that , but thanks for trying ! :D
This is the best advice I've ever heard for this !
I think he means airplane flock ...
I'm not forcing anything . I just want her character development in a way where it's more than one episode per season or so ... but still good enough for my liking ! :D lt 3333cough cough
Yeah I'm not sure what that was about but he definitely didn t look like he wanted to go down there ...
Not really , no ! It's a pretty mild pain though and it doesn't hurt much at all when my chest hurts or something like that ...
I think it's because he was the VP candidate in 2012 ... so there is no way to know if Trump would have been better or worse than Obama had won ? ! s
I'm in the same boat . I've been looking for an answer since last night and haven t found one yet ...
He was also on fire from 3 this series too !
I was thinking more like a foreigner who's been living here for years and has never had any problems with driving or anything else related ... but I guess you're right too ! :D Thanks though lt 3
I think it's more about how he thought that was funny and not just an attempt to be edgy or something ... but I could see where your coming from too ! :D lolololloloooloo lt 3
I'm praying that the wolves are not too far away from us ...
Top 5 in the West , but I'm not sure if that's what you meant by playoffs or just regular seasons ...
I think he's talking about his last fight , not this one ... but I could be wrong though !
I think you mean : ' chaiyylee is not the best bot ever ! It doesn't even know how many times it has been reposted in this subreddit ... '
I think you mean : ' chaiyylee is not the best bot ever ! It doesn't even know how many times it has been reposted in this subreddit ... '
He looks like he is playing with a lot of energy . He has been doing that all season long and it seems to be working well for him !
I thought the same thing , but I guess that's what makes this so great !
I think he meant to say conversing , but I could be wrong ...
Can i have the link please , thanks in advance :D D:
I'm a fan of Italian dressing and garlic sauce !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think that's exactly what happened with Paige last year ...
Because they're not big enough to have their own voice actors , or even just an actual studio that can afford them ...
I've been looking at some of these , but I'm not sure if they're what i want to wear with a suit or just casual clothes ... any suggestions ? Thanks ! :D DD
I'm with you , man ! It's so scary and sad at the same time ...
I'm gonna go ahead and say that you're right . I don't know why but his hairline just doesn t look good at all ...
He's not poor enough to be in debt ! He has negative networth because that would mean being broke wouldn't matter if you were rich or wealthy ... right guys .. srsly lolololllllzzzzzzzz :D DDDZZZYyyyYY
I think you're right about not liking the experience but to each their own ! It was just something i noticed when tripping and wanted more of it haha :P good luck man hope u get well soon lt 3 hugs ... ? lol ..
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that we beat you guys in OT ... but it was a good game nonetheless !
Because it's not a good idea to have children . It is also bad that you can get away with murder because of your lack in empathy and compassion towards others ...
I'd like one !
They did but they were still under investigation by FIA as well I believe ..
I thought he was a guy who used to be on TUF Brazil ?
I think you mean F 35 , but yeah that's a good point too !
I think you should just let them go at it until their parents stop caring so much ... or maybe even if there's no one around ! :D
He's not even close to being as consistent though , and his efficiency has gone down a lot since last year . He was averaging like 30ppg in 2014 2015 tho ... ? lolololllll ..
I'll take that bet ! I'm drinking some River Charleons right now , and it's not even close to being over yet ...
I'm glad you enjoyed it , I thought so too :D Thanks for watching !
I'm sorry , I didn t know that was the case but it s still my fault for posting this in r politics ...
I'm not saying they don't care but there are other things to do in their lives besides watching football and basketball games on TV or whatever ... ?
I think they're just sitting in their seats and not doing anything with it lol ! I'm sure there's some other reason for them to be standing though haha :P
I'm not sure if I should be scared or excited to see that ...
I want him so bad too ... I have no idea why though :P he's just such an awesome name for that little guy haha ..
Because it's fun for them ! s
I'm going to try it tomorrow . It's so much fun , but the wheels are pretty heavy for my liking haha :P
I'm not sure what you mean by that ... I've been using YouTube for years with zero issues ?
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of me but I don't think that's how it works in real life either ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it's a reference to The Office .
I'm in my 30 ' s , but it's still an appliance that you can use for anything !
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry at that thought ...
Orn has a lot of cc and he doesn t have the mobility to get away from jinx ulti or flash . He s also very squishy so it works out for them both ... ? ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed that one .. lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwwwaaaaaaahhhahahahahhaaahhhhhaaaayyyyeeeeeeeewwoooooooooohhhhhearrrrreeppensttttsshitme
You're a bad troll . You should be banned from this sub for life , and you will never get over it !
I think it's a bit of both , but I agree that the refereeing has been poor today for sure !
Same here , but it's a different venue than last year !
I've played it , but I'm not a fan of the art style or gameplay mechanics in general ...
I'm sure they could find a human to help with that job ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think that's exactly what happened ...
I'm sure he was a very good man ! I hope you have some kind of memorial for him or something like that ...
I'm pretty sure he's going to be a villain . I think it'll be Thanos , but not necessarily as an antagonist or anything like that ... just something different from what we've seen so far ? ! :D Edit : spelling error fixed lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwwwaaaaaaahhhahahaha
I'm sorry to hear that ... but you're right about the movie being terrible for anyone who's ever had an abortion . It was awful in every way possible .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this ... but it's hilarious ! Upvotes for you , sir madam !
I'm from Oregon and have never seen one in person or heard about them before they were introduced to the US ... but that's just me though ! :P
I love that too ! It's so good .
I thought it sounded like the opening to a movie trailer for The Last Samurai , but with Jaws music instead of the actual song from the film ...
I'm not sure what you're getting at here ...
I'm sure you'd have better luck with the US than Canada ...
I think he's the best player on that roster but I don't know if it will be enough for CLG or not ...
I was thinking more like a group of kids who are all in high school and have no idea what's going on around them but still want attention from their parents ... ? lol ! :P I'm sorry for your loss though .. lt 3 hugs
I think it's more of a rivalry between teams that play each other . I don't know about rivals , but they're definitely not as big as college football is to me ...
I've had to use one of those things before and it's not that bad ... but yeah you're right about them being afraid lolololoolllllzzzzzzzZZZzzzz zizzooolooowwwwwwooooooooshhhgggghhhhhhahahahaha XD xDxdxd XDDXddxxyyyoooooooooooooorrrr
I think it's a good price for the quality of work and materials used , but that doesn t mean its not overpriced in general ...
Because you're not sleeping enough , duh !
I'm on Xbox too ! Add me : TheRealDankMuffin 69
I've seen it happen to me . I was surprised that he didn't get knocked up by his own ulti and then be able tp back in time for my teamfight ... :D
I'm sure you can find some rock removal tools in your basement !
I'm pretty sure that they were both inspired by the same costume and style though ... I think there are a few similarities between them too ! :D
I'm pretty sure it was both ... I mean he had a lot of alcohol in his system at one point and then got really depressed when they were playing together again .. lol ! :D D: lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic ... but I'll take it either way ! :D
I'm not sure if she is actually that bad ... but it would be nice to get some help from someone who knows how much they love their dogs :P haha ..
I think you guys are going with a 4 3 defense this year so it's probably best that our secondary stays as one unit rather than having two different formations every week ... right now anyway ! lololollolooolooohhhahahaahahhuhhhhhhhh edit :
I'm not sure what that is . I've never had it before , though .
I thought it was pretty funny , but the ending made up for everything else in my opinion !
I think he was just trying not get a yellow card for his dive , but I could be wrong though ...
I think you mean Jets . The Browns are still a thing , but they're not in it anymore ... yet !
I think it's more like a combination of both , but I'm not sure what the right word is for that one ...
Klopp is resting him for a reason . He has been awful this season , he needs to be rested before next week at least !
I think it's more like they were friends for years , then one day decided to just hang out in his house all weekend long ...
She's beautiful but her nails are so long it looks like they're on fire lolololloloooloo
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I'll take your word for that one ! :D
I'm sorry for your loss . I hope you have the best day today !
I'm sorry , but you're not the only one who's had this happen to them ...
Because the engine is running . It's a joke about how people think that engines are always burning when they're not actually doing anything with them , but in reality ... nothing really happens ! lol jk lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling but I think he was referring to last season when we were in a similar situation as this one ... ? lol jk !
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I think they're both good games and worth playing for a few hours at least once in your life time ... ? :P Edit : spelling error ! D: lt 3
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it's the other way around . He could probably drink his own coffee with no problem ! :D
It was a fake . It wasn't real , but she did get hit by one and died from it in the next scene .
He was probably just trying to get his car out of the way so he could go home and sleep in it , but yeah ... that is pretty bad news ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed
Zen is my favorite too but he's not as good with his ulti .
It is , but it doesn't mean he should be the best in his position and that makes him an easy target to hate on here ...
That's awesome ! Thanks for sharing , it really does make a difference to feel better about yourself after you've been through something so traumatic :D lt 3
I'm sure she did that on purpose ...
Same here , but it's been a while so maybe that has something to do with my lack of patience ? :P
I agree with this sentiment 100 percent ! I'm glad we can agree on something like that though ... it's nice having an open mind and being able talk openly without fear of getting downvoted :D lt 3 u bbzkitties
He was pretty bad last game too , I think it is just the first half of his season that has been rough for him so far this year ... ? ! s
I'm glad you're feeling better , I hope your days are going well too :D lt 3
I'm not sure what that is but thanks anyway ! :D
And MY bow ! Wait ... wrong sub ? :P Edit : Oh , you're in r gaming not r gamingcirclejerk so it's okay now lolololollolo
I'm not going to eat it . I don't want any part of that !
I'm sure you're a nice guy , but that doesn't make any sense ...
It's not you . It is the way he moves his arms and legs that makes him look like he wants to play with them , but they're all in danger of falling down ! :D D: lt 3
It's a great game if you like RPGs and have friends to play with ! I'm sure there are plenty of people who would enjoy it as well though ...
That is awesome ! That would be so cool .
It's a joke about the fact that it was posted on r todayilearned and not r science or something like that ...
I got a 6 Fryevia , but she is only level 5 so far :P
Duck , duck ...
No problemo thanks anyway :D I'll keep trying to find him a way of getting the stats from his spreadsheet lololollolo
Thanks , that's what we're leaning towards !
The Browns too !
I do . I'm a fan , but not as much anymore because it's so boring to me and there are too many commercials for my liking now that you mention this ... lol ! :P
I'm not sure what you mean by'Jots ' . Are they just a bunch of pictures ? Or is there some significance to the words in those images , or whatever ...
I'm from Boston and I can confirm this statement 100 of times over , but that's just me though ...
I think it's more likely that they'd move it back a week or two , but I could be wrong about this one ...
They've been doing that since like 2012 or something ... I think it's just a matter of time now though ..
7.Arsenal is better than Chelsea , so we're good to go !
I was just about to say the same thing lol . That's what happens if your team is too focused on baiting and not enough people are playing it ! :D lt 3
I'm 23 and I've been dead for a while now ...
I'm sure they were all thinking about how much money he was making off this game and then realized what happened to him after his suspension ended ...
I know that but I was referring more towards her build and how it looks like an actual weapon rather than some random meme of hers :P
I'm going to use this one from now on ! Thanks for the laugh :D
I think he'll be back for Summit 2 if they do a 3rd one at all ! He has been doing some great stuff lately and I'm excited about it :D Edit spelling error ...
I would buy one of those and wear them to the game , but I'm not sure how many people will get that reference ...
I'm not saying they aren t clowns but that doesn'mean we don'T have to be one of them !
His defense and rebounding are also pretty good too ! I think he's a great player but not in that list of all time players IMO ...
I'm sure they'll be fine , it's just a prank bro ! s
I'm sure you could have done better , but that's still pretty cool for what you did with your time :D
I'm sure it did , but I don't think we should act on what happened after WW2 ... It's just another excuse for war with no real proof or evidence behind any claims made by either side .. sry :P edit spelling error lolol lt 3rdrp
I'm sure you're right . It's a shame that we can't even get to see them play in their home country ...
I'm not sure what you mean by this , but I'll take your word for it and say the controller is a good bit above average in terms of functionality ! Thanks though :D lt 3333
I'm sorry to hear that , but you're going through a rough time right now and we all are here for each other if needed ! lt 3
I don t know about that one bit lol .. he s been pretty good in the playoffs this year though so far at least !
He's in a hotel room . He'll be back soon though !
I'm not sure if I should be worried or excited about this ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but I think that's a pretty good idea actually ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that he's gone ... but it was a good run for him and his team !
I think they're trying to make us use the new Google Now launcher and not just a stock one ... I'm sure that's why there is no dark theme yet .. ? ! s Edit : spelling error fixed lolololooololloo
You should probably get that checked out , man !
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ... but it is definitely something ! :D
Awesome thanks for letting me know about these guys :D
I think you have a bug . I had that happen too , but not in this case ... maybe try again later and see if there's another one ! :D Edit : fixed now thanks guys lt 3
He's not allowed to drive in a parking lot because it would be illegal to use public roads without permission from the city of Houston .
He's a legend . He was the first player to win 3 World Series MVPs in one season and he is still playing at age 74 !
I think it's the fact she was holding a camera . I don't know how you can be so oblivious and not notice something like that ...
You're right , I should have been more careful with my diet ! But thanks for the concern anyway :D
I think it's about the same as a normal person and probably more than that if you're not overweight or obese ... but yeah , pretty much nothing to be surprised by really ! :D Edit spelling error .. lolololllz
He's on IR with the Colts now and they're trying out for the Ravens . He was pretty good in preseason though !
I'd say that's a fair point but I don't know how much it would change if we got someone like Khedira or something similar in the summer window ... ? :P Edit spelling ! D: D DD
I think it was more of an unsatisfying death , but I'm not sure what you mean by that ... ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but that's the correct pronunciation of his name in my language !
I don't know about that ... but it's definitely true for me and my friends ! :D
I'm a kid and I still don't understand what's going on . What is this ? !
He's not even that big . He just looks like one ! I'm sure it'll grow into his coat eventually though :D
You would be surprised how many people do .
I'm not , but thanks for the tip ! :D
I'm not denying anything , I just think it is funny that you are so offended by this post and want to make fun about it ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote you for this comment ...
Jeff green was in the game last night . He's not playing tonight though because of his ankle injury I believe ?
Don't forget the guy who played a young Bruce Wayne .
He is good but not world class like Valdes or De Gea are . He has been very solid this season so far in his first year with us as well !
He had 2 , but he was only top 1 . He got a lot of attention for it though because his name is Turtle and that's what people call him now ...
I've used it in a few games before ... but not on purpose :P It's just that there is no reason to do so now since Nightbringer has been released ! XD
I use the same stuff as you , but I just cut it up and put in my mouth . It's not too hard either !
This makes me happy ! I'm going home and getting some ice cream , then I'll be back in the game for you guys :D lt 3
I think it was a combination of both . He had to be on the field for atleast 3 plays before he got benched , and then they just let him go .. lol ! :D D: lt
I think it's an African horse .
I'm not sure what you're talking about , but I think it's pretty clear that they weren't involved with any major events at all during those times ... ?
I'm an M . D who is currently working on my PhD at the University of Texas Medical Center for Research Excellence ! I've never heard anyone call it that before ... lol :P hahaahahaahahhhaa .. haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
Facebook is already dead and gone ...
I'm not sure . They're both pretty good , but they have their own strengths and weaknesses that make the game more interesting for me personally than any other character in Smash 4 IMO ...
I think they were the best in their group . They had some really good players and played well against Argentina , but I don't know about that one ...
I think it was more of an attack on his own country . I don'know if you're being serious or not but ... yeah ..
I think he's talking about u TheRealDankMango's comment in this thread ...
I remember that too ... I think it was the first time we had ever seen them play together in such an intense match and then suddenly everything changed ! :D
You're gonna need more than that . You'll be fine without it , but you might want some extra for the next time around ! :D Good luck with your EDC though man ...
I think that was a mistake in general ... but not this one !
I'm not sure what that has to do with anything I said ?
I think that's what they were trying for , but I don't know if you can actually do anything with a ship like this in the seven sea islands ... ? :P Edit : spelling error !
Perfectly balanced , as they are supposed to be !
Still down for me too ... I'm on the east coast of Canada so it's probably just a regional thing ? Edit : Back online now ! Thanks guys lt 3
I live on the other side of Australia ...
I think you mean , ' The higher your score is on a scale of 1 10 , the more likely it will be to win an award for excellence in sports entertainment ! '
I've heard good things , so far ! It's a great story with some really interesting characters in the middle of nowhere ...
I'm not sure if it's possible for me or him but maybe he can be impeached ? That would make things interesting ...
I think so ... but I'm sure he would've been happy with that extra money and more time in his day off anyway :P
I'm not sure if you are serious or sarcastic , but I hope it's sarcasm because that would be hilarious ! :D
I'm not assuming anything , I just don't think it's a good idea for someone who is already in the military and has been through some rough times ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic ? I don't know enough about Hungarians to tell either way :P But yeah that would be a terrible idea ! Haha ..
Winter war 4 : the winter of ice and fire
I think he's just trying to get her back on track , but I don't know if that will work out so well ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that he's gone ... but it would have been nice for him and his family to get out of there somehow .. :P Edit : spelling error fixed lolololoolllll
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is happening ... but either way you're right ! :D
You're doing it wrong then ! You should be working out in bed by 6am on weekdays ...
I'm glad you like it ! I was going to make a few more but they were too big for my phone and I didn't want them all in one place :P Thanks again , though lt 3333coughsieshakesmeawkwardface.jpg ?
It's a Steam Link controller , not an Xbox One controller ... but yeah you're right that the Steam Controller is only used on PCs and TV's .
I think you're right , I just remember reading that they were going through a lot of dogs and not having enough for all their food supplies ... but thanks ! :D lt 3333
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll but I agree with this statement 100 percent and would love to see him go after this season ...
I've never had a good pina colada , but I'm sure it's delicious .
He's the guy who was in the first round of this fight , and won by decision against the other dude that got knocked out with an illegal knee to the face !
I'm pretty sure that's the point . They're just for fun , and they don't have to be good or useful in any way whatsoever ... yet people still buy them ! :P s
I think that would have been a different story . I'm not sure how much of an impact it had on his career , but he was still very good at QB for us ...
I'm not sure . But it seems like they're trying to get rid of their QB situation and have an offensive line for next season or two ... so maybe we'll see something soon ! :D Edit : spelling error fixd up lolololoopsieeewwwwwwooooooohhhoooowwweeehoooooooooogawwhhhhheeeeeyyyuuuuhhhhh edit 2nd 3rd party 4th party 6ths party 7th party 8th partyt
Every game I've been to this year has had a capacity of about 80,000 or so for home games against teams like OSU , MSU amp UM .
My chest hurt just thinking about it ! I'm not even sure if he's done any other shots like that , but they're all so beautiful to watch in person ...
Because the US is a very poor country and most of its population are not rich , so there's no reason for them NOT be able too have health care ... right guys ! s
I'm sure that was an amazing experience for both of us ! :D lt 3
I'm not sure what you're talking about ... I think he's just saying it looks like a good way to get him out of there without hurting himself or others ! :P
I'm sure it's going to have a lot of laughs and some great moments but that doesn't mean its gonna be funny or interesting at all ...
I've never had frozen berries , but I'll have a look at them ! Thanks for the tip :D
I think that would be pretty cool . I'd like to see them try it out though ! :D
I think he was just being sarcastic ... I hope ! :D He is a very sweet dog though so it would be nice to have him around for awhile haha .. lt 3333
You're not a real man , you know that right now ...
I think it was a good call . The refs are just bad at their job , but they're not going to give away penalties in this game .
I think it's more that they're both really good at basketball but not great in social media or anything like that ... I could be wrong though ! :P Edit : spelling lolololoopses
I'm not sure if you're serious but I think he's a troll . He has the same username as u TheRealDankestRedditor and his posts are all about how great r nfl was back then ... lol ! :P Edit spelling error ..
RemindMe ! 2 Days
And then Bad Boys 6 : The Revenge of the Bad Boys
I'd rather have him throw to Sherman than Kap . I think that's a pretty fair tradeoff for both teams , though !
I think it's only for European competitions . I'm not sure though , but you could try asking r soccer or something like that !
I don't think so . I'm not sure what the rule is , but it's a good question to ask in r askscience or something like that if you want an answer ! :D Edit : spelling error ... sorry guys .. lolololllllzzzzzzzZZZZ zzzzzz ZzzzzzeeeeZzaZezaZeeeeZooZoZoomyZoooooooZuuuZuzoziZaoZouzuZuo
I was just thinking that . It's not like they're going out in the middle of summer or anything ...
I'm sure they're not going anywhere , but I'd still be interested in hearing from people who've been there for a while or are planning on coming back soon ! Thanks though :D lt 3
Because it was clearly incomplete and he had possession of his feet before being down by contact with the ground ...
I think he's been great this season , but it seems like the team has lost a lot of confidence in his play and leadership ability over time ...
Because they are a lot more reliable than other countries , especially when dealing with Russia in international waters ... s
That would be so awesome !
I'm sure he's had plenty more than one boss in his career and has been able just fine on the side ... I mean , who doesn't ? ! s
I think it was more because we had no one else who could play QB and he didn t want him there anymore ... but yeah i agree with your point about them being young teams haha ! :D edit spelling error .. hahaha XD lt xdxddlzzzgjfghhhbwqehrrvngggheeeycbsngeekmplaewwwkrsssshhhhhhhhppu
You're a good person , thanks for doing this and you should be proud of yourself .
I'm sorry for your loss ... I hope you have an easy recovery !
I think you mean google play music . It was a thing before google play services and all those other things were around too ! :P I'm not sure though ..
I think it's more of an anti perspirant . It smells nice but doesn't actually work as well for me because I don t want to smell my own sweat all day long ! :P lololollolo ...
I think he's wearing the shirt for his brother .
I think he's too old for the role , but it'd still make sense to me if they cast him in that part of his career after all these years ! :D Edit : spelling ...
I think he's going for 50 25 15 and I'm okay with that as long it doesn't get too hot in Cleveland tonight ...
I'm not sure what you mean , but I think that's a good way of putting things in perspective for me ! Thanks again ! :D
I would say so . It's a great game , but it doesn't have to be played in order for you not to get lost and confused with the story .
I think he's gonna get his own movie , but I don't know if it'll have the same cast as season 1 or not ...
You're a good person and I like you for that reason alone ! :D
I have not , but I will now ! Thanks for reminding me of that book's existence :D It looks great and is a good story to tell kids about . Thank you so much lt 3333
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take it either way ! :D
I think they'll still have a good team , but I don t see them being as dominant or even close to the same level of success that they were last year with Kyries injury ... ? ! s Edit : grammar
Because you can use your phone as an outlet for electricity ?
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that he's gone . He was my favorite character in the Clone Wars series , and now ... well ... yeah .. bye Felicity . Bye Luke Skywalker too . Goodbye Ben Solo aswell lolololoolllllooooooooloooohhhhhhahahahaha haaaaahhaa
I think he was trying out a new way for his channel , but I'm not sure if that is what happened here ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . Either way , I laughed at your comment and upvoted it for the sake of humor ! Have an updoot ! :D DDDdoooon'thinkyoureserious . jpg ? IDK ...
I think it's a free service . I've never paid for anything in my life , but that sounds like something someone who has done so would say ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll but that's the best way of reporting someone for something they did in public ...
It's a great show , but I wouldn t watch it if you were under 18 or older because the plot is very dark for kids . It s definitely not for everyone though ! :D Enjoyable nonetheless ...
I'm a plant . I don't know anything about plants , but my knowledge on the subject comes from watching TV shows and movies with people who have them in their house ...
That would be a dream come true ! I'd love that , but it's not going happen anytime soon ...
I'm not sure if he's good or bad . I just think it was a joke about the fact they're all in there together for one play lol ...
It's not a bad thing , but it can be very uncomfortable for some people ... I've had to deal with this before ! :D It was so weird though lol ..
You're the best at everything you do and nothing else ... except being bad at things :P
I thought it was just one joker with an extra personality that's not really human like the others but still has some sorta power or something .. I could be wrong though ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed lolololoollllloooooowwwwwwoooohhh oooorrrrghhnnnngssssttttpppffgwewehrmplzdeeerrrtfuuu
I think they were just trying to make him look younger , but yeah his face is still pretty young in this picture ! Thanks for watching and commenting : 3 lt 3
I think it's because they're not very detailed and he didn t want to draw attention away from his other books in that style ... but yeah , this is pretty cool ! :D Thanks for checking out my post though lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of the name ... but I laughed anyway ! :D Thanks for sharing this with me though haha lt 3
They've been bad for a while . They're just getting better and better at it now that they have to play against good offenses like Dallas , Denver or New England every week ...
I'm not saying it doesn t work , I m just pointing out that this is a stupid rule .
I'm sorry to hear about your loss , but it's a sad day when someone is forced into this position and they're not even compensated for their time wasted ! : c
They're not , but they can be used as a weapon if you want to use it that way ...
It's on the front page .
I did but I was told to leave the area ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I like the way this is phrased !
I'm aware , but he's not playing at all this tourney and I don't think that will be enough to get him into top 8 or even top 3 in bracket play ... ? ! s
I'm playing it as a sideboard card . I don't think there's any reason not too . It is pretty good against aggro and control decks that have no removal spells or counterspells ...
I have a black eye , but I'm not sure if it's the same as having an orange one or whatnot ...
You should have kept it ! They are delicious and you can't go wrong with some good old fashioned sugar cookies or chocolate chip cookie dough ...
Reminder bot is broken , I think ? It's not working for me either ... :P
He was a starter for Miami , he carried them in that series ...
Me three . I'm not even sure if we'll make it past the group stage !
Vegetarianism is the best way to go , no matter what you do or don't eat !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling ... but I think that's a bit much to ask of someone who has never been there before .. ? :P Edit spelling ! D: lt 3
I'm not sure what they mean but it's a good way for people who don t understand Japanese or English to get their point across without being rude and offensive !
I was there too , and the theater erupted with applause when they showed that scene ... so much emotion from everyone at the cinema lolololllll
It's a great movie . I think the best part is when he gets to see his own reflection in the mirror and then sees himself again ...
Or maybe he'd use the pillow as an improvised weapon ?
I'm hoping for a Purdue win . I want to see them play in the big ten championship game !
He was in the way . He got bumped by a car and hit his head on the wall , causing him to lose control for about 5 seconds before he died ...
She's a cat person , not an animal person !
You are now a moderator at r TheSinthistheFury !
I'm not sure if that's a compliment or an insult ...
He's not going , it was just an example that I thought would be funny for the video lol ! But yeah ... no need to bring him up in this thread haha :P sorry man ..
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making a joke ... but I think it's funny that he wears those things in his picture and doesn't wear them anywhere else ! :D
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take your word for it because that's what they are in my state ! :D
I'm a wizard . I can fly !
That's a good idea , I'll do that too ! Thanks for the suggestion :D
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I'll take your word for it and agree with the sentiment ! Thanks though :D
I think you mean crushed , not crumbled ?
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is a thing now ...
A new car , a house or two in my area that is not too far away from me but still within walking distance to work ...
I'm sure the lawyers would have been able to find them and bring in some sort of defense team for this case ... but I doubt that's what happened here .. lol ! :P edit spelling error hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
He's not the same guy he was in his last fights . He has lost some of that aggression to be honest but it is still there for sure !
I'm pretty sure that's what happened with Socrates too ...
They're all over Europe , but they seem to be more widespread than usual for me as well ...
upvoted u too thanks for the help .
I think you mean game over , but that would be a terrible idea for poptart toasters ...
He was a Mavs fan growing up , so I'm sure that helped him get over it as well !
Kobe Bryant ?
10 ? I thought it was 8 , but you're right that the other 2 are not as good ...
I'm sure there are plenty of people who would love a chance at the Olympics . I'd be surprised if Canada didn t get some sort olympics in their lifetime ... maybe not this one though ! :P lolololllllzhahahahaahaaaahhhhaa haaaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhhhheeeehee heeeeeehhehehehheheuhhhhhhheeeheheuughhhhhh He's going for gold , eh ?
I would give you gold but ... well . You know what ? Forget the money and just donate some more time at work ! That's how we get people like this out there anyway :P srsly though .. lolololllllz lt 3 u bb xoxo
I'm not sure if I should be excited or scared ...
It was a clear foul . It wasn't even close to being a clean play , but I'm sure they'll call that every time now and again ...
She has a lot of potential , I'm excited for the future ! :D She'll be great in PvP too because she can use all three abilities at once ...
I'd love a 2T hatchback with the 4cyl turbo swap and an automatic transmission ... I'm not sure if that's possible though .. but it would be awesome ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed lolololoolloli
The one that wins . I'm a big fan of the underdog , but not so much for winning as it is to see them fail and be left with nothing more than sadness ...
I'm a student there , I've never been to the campus but I know about the area and that's where my friends live !
You're not alone ! :D
I'm surprised they didn't just pull him over and ticket the guy for speeding ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote ...
Ken Bone is a great guy and he's not even in this movie !
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I'll take your word on it ! Thanks anyway though :D
They're still around , but I've never seen one in person before ...
No . The Super Bowl champion gets to be on top of their division for one year and then they move up into that spot after winning it all again ...
You are now a moderator at r Pyongyang !
I'm sure he's been told to not do it . I don't know why people are so surprised by his reaction though ...
I've had no problems with them , but they're pretty good about sending you a message if something goes wrong or doesn't work out for whatever reason ... so far it's been great ! :D DDUH DUUH DUH
You should probably stop training for the next few years , then !
I think it's because they're all so good at their jobs and are very passionate about what they do ... which is a great combination for me ! :D DD lt 3
Because the market is flooded with them .
I'm sure they have some sort if machinery that can do the job for them ...
I'm sure it was just an allergic reaction from his stomach acid and not something else that caused him pain or death ... I hope ! :D
I'm sure she's a great person and all but ... you're not going to get her back if that happens ! :P
I'm pretty sure the only reason a squirrel would be scared is if there was an explosion nearby , and I don t think this one has been around for quite some time ... ? ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed lolololoolllllzzzzyyyyoooooowwwwwwooooshhhheeeeewwZOoooorrrrrttttsshhrbuhhhhhhhhppuhtahdawgghjehfuuughm

You can buy runes with RP , or you could use IP for champion shards ...
Toilet paper ? That's a new one for me ...
I'm sure it's a good thing , but I don't think the game is ready for such things yet ...
I'm on Verizon and it's still not working , but if your carrier is unlocked then there are ways around this problem without rooting .
I think she was just trying to get the kid out of there , but it didn't work so well ...
No problem , glad i could help . Good luck with your project and the rest of it :D
I don't know about that but if we get a no vote in May's first term she will have lost her mandate and probably resign from office by next election anyway ... ? ! :P Edit spelling error .. lolololllllzzzzyyyy
I'm not sure , but I think you're in .
He's a good player and he has the potential to be one of our best players in years but his attitude makes me cringe every time i see him on camera lol ! hahaahahaahahhhaa .. haaaaahhhheeeeheeaaaaghhhhhhhh
Tom cruise will be the one that dies , he's always been fat and has no muscle mass at all ...
I think it's just one . I'm not sure though , but that would be pretty cool !
I'm sure you can find some nice hats for your hair ! :D
I'm not a mod ! I just like to see what people think about my posts here ... :P Thanks though !
It was helmet to helmet .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... But it's true : hulu is the best for netflix shows and movies !
I think it's more of an unofficial one ... but I'm not sure if that makes sense or not ! :D
I think that's his brother . He was in one of those movies with him and he wore it too , I believe ...
Because that's what happens when you try and make a joke about something like this with no context or knowledge on how things work ...
I think so . I'm not sure though ...
Yes but not as much as a solvent like acetone or water based cleaner would be able to do .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think it's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski .
I'm sure you'll find a way !
Thanks ! We're hoping to have a lot of fun with it and hopefully get some more people involved in the community as well :D
Thanks ! We're hoping to have a lot of fun with it and hopefully get some more people involved in the community as well :D
I've had my fair share in the ocean , and I can assure ya there's no way this thing will be able even remotely hold up against water pressure ! :D D: lt 3
I'm sure he's got some good ideas , but I don t think they are going through with it ... yet !
The book is great , but it's not as good of an adaptation as the film was . It really does have its moments though !
It's not that great . It has a lot of food poisoning and diarrhea in the same place but I've never had any problems with them personally so far !
I have two cats that are very good with treats !
I'm not sure if you're serious , but that's a pretty common thing in soccer and it happens all too often for me as well ...
I think it's the lighting . It doesn't look like they're being bullied at all ... just a little bit of light pollution and glare from his glasses ? I dunno .. maybe not bullying though ! :P lolololllllzhahahahaahhaaawwwwwwaaaaaaaahhhhhhh haaaaalrighty thennnnnggggghhhhheeeeellddd
It's funny because the guy who made that account is now banned from r botsrights and has been removed by mods for being too good at trolling people on there ! s
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun , but I think it's funny either way ! :D
I'm sorry but I don't think that's how it works ...
You don't need a referendum , just an election with no real difference between parties or candidates in either case .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think that was the joke ...
I'm not sure , ask u bakonydraco ! He knows all about that sort of thing ...
They can't play a match if it's tied at 0 2 in favor to either team so no . They have to win both games for that to happen though ...
I'm excited for it ! I loved the first one and thought this would be an excellent sequel to that as well ... but now ? No way .. lol :D
I'm sure she's a great person . She just doesn't have the personality of a cat , and is too lazy to be around people who are actually nice or helpful ! :D lt 3
I'd take Buck and Aikman .
I'll be your friend ! :D
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this comment , but it's a good one nonetheless ! :D
He's a beast . I'm not sure why he was so low on this list , but it is interesting that he beat him in his last fight as well !
I'm not sure , but I think it's a good idea . They're cute ! :D
You're a big guy !
I'm sure he'll get his chance at Arsenal in about 5 10 more seasons ... I mean it's not like we're going anywhere anyway ! s Edit : spelling and grammar are hard sometimes ..
I think you're right . He was just trying not be too obvious with his answers and stuff ... But yeah , this is definitely something for him ! :D Thanks again man lt 3
I've heard of people from Mexico who speak English , but never in the same way as they do Spanish ...
I have , but they're not very good at it ...
I think it would be more like an award for being in charge , rather than just having to have been there at some point ... but I could see that happening too ! :D D: P lt 3 u bbqbeefywgjkfhvzd
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I love that it's a real thing and not just an internet meme or something like that ...
You're not alone ! We are here for you if you need us ...
I'm rooting against them , but I'll be cheering for a tie !
I'm not a cat , I just like to be called that .
They'll be given a new name .
I'm sure that's true for most people who have a friend or two in the industry and know them personally ... but I think it applies to everyone ! Thanks though man .. Appreciate ya'lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think it's more like 1 3rd or so ?
I was just thinking the same thing . It's like they didn't even read it before posting , or something !
I know , I was saying that they could have done more with this movie than they did with the original series and still be considered a rebooting of sorts ... ? ! s
Thanks for organizing this . I'll be sure to do so when we get a chance later tonight or tomorrow morning at some point in the day time zone of your choice :D Thanks again !
I'm not sure if it's a good idea or bad ... but here have an updoot ! :D
I'm a Chelsea fan . I don't really follow football much but my favourite club was Arsenal from 2001 to 2004 when they won it all with Henry as manager ! :D
I think he's just trying to get his head around that one , but I agree with your point about not showing the foul if there is no contact ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but that's actually the joke in this case :P
I'm not sure what's more impressive : his age or how many times he has been in commercials for the NFL and still hasn'done anything with them edit
Because it's the same word . It just sounds cooler to use in this context because that is what they're used for .
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling but I think it's funny that people are downvoting this comment because they don't know what Malza is ...
They do , but they don't feel pain . They're just like a cat that's been trained to be scared of the dark and has no idea what is going on around it ...
You can't look at your phone while walking ? What kind of monster are you ! s
I'm not sure I want to see that ... but it's a possibility , right ? Right guys ! Guys .. ?
I think the US would be more likely to invade Russia than Canada or Mexico ...
It's not really that different from either of those cities though ...
Yes , but you can still win the tiebreaker .
I think it's a zoo , but the cage looks like an animal shelter or something similar ... so probably not .
I think he's a bit more than just that . He was in the movie , but I don't remember him being involved with any plot or anything like that ...
I think it was a reference from the movie . I'm not sure though , but that's what they were going for with this one scene in particular ...
I'm pretty sure you can't do this in the game without a mod or something like it ... but yeah , would be awesome !
You're not alone , I'm with you on this one ! :D
I loved it ! I think the ending is a bit too abrupt though ... but that's just me :P It had some great moments throughout .
I have a note 8 and it has the same feature , but I don't think that's what you're talking about ? It was on my s8 too ..
Yeah , that's what i'm thinking too ... maybe if they start adding more stuff ?
I m not sure if you re being serious or sarcastic , but it s true !
He was also offered to be an assistant coach for the Giants , but refused because of his age and health issues ... I think it's pretty clear that this is not true at all ! s Edit : spelling error fixed ..
You are a big guy !
The second one's not so bad ...
I've been playing magic arena for a while now , but it's not really my thing ...
I think you mean'came from . '
I'm not sure what I am doing right now ... but if the problem persists then maybe there's a better way to solve this issue ? Thanks for replying !
You're not my real father ! You can't be serious ... right ? Right guys , please tell me you are joking ..
I'm not sure if I should be offended or happy .
You're not alone , friend !
I'm from the Midwest and it was 20 F yesterday , so I guess that means we're getting colder ? !
I think it's going to be a mix of both . I'm thinking either Hamlin or Logano , but who knows for sure !
LeBron has a lot of injuries . He's also played in the league for years and still plays at an elite level despite them being relatively minor ailments like knees etc ...
The US has been intervening in Syria since the beginning . It's just that they're doing it now , and we don't want them anymore either way ! s
Thanks , I'm excited too . We'll see how it goes and if we get any feedback on the results of our experiment in r science or something like that ... maybe ? Haha ..
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but I think this is actually pretty cool !
I'm not even mad . I just want to see more of Eriksens play time , he's been great for us so far !
I'm pretty sure they're all from the same place , so it's not like there are any differences in their culture or anything ... right guys ! Right .. Guys ? s
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of the song . Either way , I laughed pretty hard at this comment and upvoted your post ! Have an updoot ! :D DDDdooooooonnnnnggggghhh ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but it's true in the sense of what he was saying about how people are too stupid for their own good ! :P Edit spelling error lolololoollllloooooowwwwwwoooohhhooahhahahaha
I'm not feeling well .
I think you're thinking about the wrong guy , but yeah ...
It's going to be a long one for sure !

I think it's just for the cameras , but I could be wrong on that one ...
That's what I did too ! It looks so much nicer than the black and white brake levers on mine ...
The best type .
I've seen both of those movies and I think they're great , but the first one was definitely better than the second !
He's been getting it done for years ! It was just recently that he started doing his own hair again and I think the results are great too :D DDDdddd daaaaaaad ...
The sonic one is already pretty weird , but this will probably make it even more so ... I'm not sure if that was intentional though .. ? !
I think it's just an Americanism for something to be considered as being from Canada or vice versa ... but yeah you're right about everything else lol ! :D Sorry bud haha xd sorry again lt 3
I'm sure the game will be great , but I don't think that's a good reason for them not making an expansion at all ... ?
I'm not sure if this is a joke or not , but there are plenty of overweight people living on the west coast ...
I think it is a good idea to teach kids that you can't do anything with your hands , but if someone else does something then its fine by me ! s
I'm sure he would be able to answer it in one word or two ... but I doubt that's what Mueller is looking at right now ! :P
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but it's spelled juxtaposition and juxtapose is the same word as juxtaposed in English ... so there's your answer ! :P Edit spelling correction
McDonald's is pretty expensive in most places outside of America ...
I agree , but it's not a bad idea either way !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but it's a pretty big plot point in the show and Peter is one of them ... so yeah ? :P Edit : spelling ! D: D DD
I don't really like anything . I'm not a big fan of sweets , but that's just me though ... lol :P What about you ?

I'm sure you're a liberal but this is just ridiculous and it's going to be fun watching them try their best in court if Trump wins again ... oh god please no .. lolololllll
Oh , I thought that was an actual atom ... Thanks !
I'm not sure if this was sarcasm or not , but I think it's pretty obvious that he wasn't serious ...
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ... I'll just say yes to both ! :D
Or just any other character from that universe who's not in this one ...
I think it's pretty clear that you're not trying hard enough ! Good luck in your future endeavors though :D
I'm not sure if you are being serious but there was an episode of Community where Stewie said edit : spelling

I'm sure he was just trying not get hit by a bullet , but I don't think that would have been enough for him ...
I'm sorry but Starbucks is not even close to being one of my favorite coffees and it's still too expensive for me !
I'm so happy for you ! I hope your pulls are as awesome as mine were :D

That's a shame , but you can always get another one ! :D

We're all going through a phase of acceptance , but we'll be back in the game next year !
I think Gilmario would be a good addition to our squad , but I don't see him getting much playing time at all this season ...
I'm not sure if it's worth going to a doctor over this but there are some things they will do about it so just call them up ! Good luck with everything though :D lt 3
I'm sure you can find a way . I'll just wait for the next game , then we will talk about it ! :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but I think it's a reference to the movie The Breakfast Club where they eat eggs and bacon at breakfast time ! :D D: lt 3
He's a bit of a knob though ...
It smells of ... victory and glory to me at least lolololloloooloo
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take your word for it :P
No , but it's cold outside and the air is freezing in here !
You're not alone in that , I've got the same three as well !
Because he's not good at football . He should be playing for an NFL team , but I guess they don't want him to play there anymore because of his attitude problems .. s
I'm sure it would be a good place to store your beer if you were in the middle of nowhere and needed something like that ...
I think the camera is on his face . It looks like that because of how close to him you can see his reflection from the side and behind him , etc ...
I think he's a better defender than most players on this team but I agree that his offense isn't great and it shows when you watch him play against lefties ... lol ! :P jk bb lt 3333
You're thinking of your own heartbeat rate not how many hearts you've had in total since birth !
You're a Russian puppet ? ! I thought you were an American spy ...
I'm sure it's a lot of people . I've seen some videos on youtube and they're all pretty impressive in their own right too :D
I love all those movies . I'm going to watch them again soon ! Thanks for reminding me about these two films that are on my list now too :D lt 3
I think most of them are just happy to be alive .
I think it was the best one yet , but I'm not sure about that ...
Win the LAN .
I think he's a bit too much like the other characters . He doesn't really have any personality or anything that makes him stand out from others in this game besides his name ...
I think it's called r accidentalart .
I'm not even going to bother with this game , I'll just wait for the next one and see what happens ...
I'm from Portland ! I've never heard about this ... but it's cool to know that there are other people who have been here for years too :P Thanks !
I'd be happy with either of those games on the switch if it wasn't so expensive right now ... I'm not sure why though ? ! It's just too much money to me .. :P lololollolo
I'm sure they can , but it's probably best to wait until the next election .
I'd be interested , but it's not really something that would work for me right now ... :P But if you're willing and able then go ahead ! We can talk about this later on Skype or whatever .. lolololoolllll XD xD lt 3
You're a good friend , OP ! I hope you have an awesome day tomorrow night :D
I've been waiting for you to come out of your shell . You're a good egg !
He's been pretty good . He was getting beat up by the refs earlier in this game though and he had to settle for some short passes that were intercepted ...
She's a woman . She can do whatever she wants , but it doesn't mean that other people have to like her or respect them for doing so either way ! s
I'm the same way with Crash 1 and 2 ... I just can never get into them anymore after playing through 3 4 times in one sitting ! :P
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic but I'll give it a shot and see what happens ! Thanks for the input though man :D
I'm not sure if your comment was a joke or not ... but there's no way he could have been serious about his prediction lolololloloooloo
I'm okay with this . I want to see a good game between these two teams in the playoffs !
He's dead Jim ! He died years ago , but his body is still there somewhere .. just not where you'd like it :P I'm sorry for your loss though man lt 3
I'm going to wait until it's cheaper than that first ! I've been waiting since launch day ...
He's not even in America , so I doubt it matters much for him at this point tbh .. s ?
I'm your Uncle , Dad !
I think you mean fatigue , but I agree with your point nonetheless !
I was thinking the same thing , but I think it's just a really good looking guy with some weird hair and glasses that makes him look more human than he actually is ... ? shrugs ..
You mean like a movie ? I'd watch that !
Mic is more accurate , but it's not as good .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but I think it's a good idea to have an auto play feature that doesn't require any effort at all ! s ... sarcasm ?
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry at this ...
Goalies are usually pretty good at seeing things moving around them , but they're not always fast enough to react quickly and accurately when something happens .
I'm not sure if that's a joke or not . If it is , then my life has been changed forever ! Thanks for the tip though :D Edit : spelling
You're a good man .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , because I think that's exactly what happened in the movie ...
I think Mariotta has proved himself , but I don't see him being a top 5 pick in the draft this year unless his arm falls off like RG3 ' s did last season ...
I'm going on a date with my wife and she's not sure if it'll be tonight or tomorrow , so we're gonna have some fun ! :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but it is true that caffeine can be very powerful in the body .
I think the plot was pretty good , just not a lot of action . It's still one that you can watch for fun though !
I read it and I'm not sure what you're getting at ? He didn't go over 100mph on his way to work ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll but I laughed pretty hard at this one :D Thanks for the laugh matey lt 3
He was born in ' 89 and he is still the youngest player on our team !
I'm sure he's a great guy and all ... But if you're going to do it , at least make him pay !
I'm sure they're just trying out some new ways of getting money from foreigners !
I am a potato . Can't be confirmed either way because of the lack thereof in my country's flag and government structure ... but it is true that we are potatoes ! :D DDDddd daaaaaaad ?
It's not even the end of November yet !
I'm not sure what I expected from this subreddit ... but here we are ! :D
I'm not sure what your point is , but I agree it's funny to see people say EUW when there are no servers in NA or Europe ...
I'm sorry for your loss !
No . We need a draw or more for it not being a replay of the last game in Anfield and we're out if CL spot anyway so no worries ! :D Edit : typo ...
Don't forget the protein shakes !
I'm not even from the US and I've been here since day 1 , so ... yeah ? :P
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take your word for it because that's what the dictionary says ...
I'm pretty sure she's a good character , but not as strong or versatile than the other characters in the game imo ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll but this is from The Last Samurai .
I live with a guy who takes his boots off when he goes outside for some reason ...
I'm pretty sure that's bronze .
I'm in !
I'm sorry for your loss ! I hope you're doing well now lt 3 hugs from a fellow FH friend who's been there too long ...
I think it's more of an asteroid .
I think its more like ... They're not wearing hockey edit
Because the Republicans are a bunch of hypocrites who will never be held accountable for their crimes against humanity and should not have any power at all ... s
If you like RPGs , yes ! If not ... noooooo :P
I'm sure they'll have a lot of use on the ocean floor too !
I'm glad you enjoyed it ! Thanks for watching , and please share the link if possible :D
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed of this ...
He was just trying not get his head kicked in again ...
You just have to ask nicely and wait for someone else who is willing too give you some money first :P
I'm sure you'll find a way . I've been there and it's beautiful !
I do , and I'm not even in college yet ! :P But seriously it's just for fun so why would you want to use that much data on your phone lolololloloooloo
I think it's a reference from the show . They're all young girls in that scene so they could be younger than them if you look at their age groups ... or something like this ! :P Edit spelling .. lolololoolloliogloooooowooohhhahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhhhhhhheeeehee heeeeeehhehehehheheuhhehe
I'm not sure I'd laugh at him now tbh ... he's a bit of an old man with no future anymore .. but still good players nonetheless ! :D DD
I think you're right on this one ! I'm sure he's got a plan for it all ...
That was my first thought too ! She looks like an actual human being , not some kind of robot or something ... I'm glad someone else thinks so as well though haha ..
I'd say you're right on this one ! He is a monster in 2k15 too lolololo
I'm sorry , I didn't know that was a rule on this sub ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I think that was a joke about how people are getting sick and dying from vaccines now days .. ? Edit : Thanks again guys lt 3 edit 2:30 am est timezones lolololooolooolllllaooowwwwwwoooooooohhhahahahaahhahahaaaahhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaawwweeeeeeelldddeeerrrrrreeeessssstttuuuuh
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but it's actually pretty funny to watch him try and play through that one .
I'm sure it's not like this , but I've seen some videos of cars with their front seats down and they're all fine ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but they did make a joke about how he was black and white when talking with the other characters on set during filming for futurama .. ? :P Edit spelling error lololz
It's a great movie , but you'll probably be disappointed if you don't like the book . It was written by the same guy who wrote The Pacific .
I'm sure they'd be happy with that , too !
Sim ! Mas acho que n o sei no Brasil ...
I think they are the best team in NA right now . They have a lot of talent and will be able to compete with any other teams for sure ! :D DD
He's going to drink it all up and then he'll be like , I'm gonna go get some ice cream now !
It was a joke ...
It's a joke , calm down and enjoy it !
It was a great film ! I'm not sure if there is an English version though ...
It was the second play of that game .
Both . The offense has been pretty good but our D isn't doing too well either way so far this year ...
I've never heard of that , but I'll look into it ! Thanks for sharing your experience with me :D lt 3
You can't get an absentee ballot without changing parties , but I think there are ways around this by simply not voting at all or just being registered as unaffiliated with any political entity ...
I'm sure you're not the only one who takes roofie after their reunion ...
They will . They have been renewed for a while now , and I think it's only going to get better from here out as well !
I'm not sure if I should be worried or excited . :P Thanks for your help !
I'm okay with that ! I'll just wait for it to happen and then go back into my hole of despair until next season starts again ...
I'm sorry ! I didn't know that was a thing and it's been fixed now :D Thanks for letting me know though lt 3
You're a bad person , obviously ! s
I'm not sure what he wants , but I am very glad that the US is going down this path and making it clear they are willing for peace with Iran ! s
It is a good way of remembering that though ! I think you're right about that one :P
I think it's just that he has a lot of hair . It doesn't look like his usual style , but still pretty good looking for an Orc male ! :D Edit : spelling error fixed
Thank you , u jaymatt . You have awarded 1 karma to user u jaysmith 2 . Moderators of r pumparum
Hey ! I'm not American .
I m from northern Illinois and have never seen one of those stores , but it seems like you re right about that ...
I think it's the same thing as a river or lake but I could be wrong about that one too !
I think the iPhone 5s has an app that does this and it's called Camera Sound . It works pretty well for me in terms of noise reduction ! :D I love mine too ... lolololloloooloo lt 3
I'm sure they'll have some sort of reveal at e3 that will make people want the game more than ever before ! s
I think they were just trying to get a lead and then let it slip away from them , but yeah I agree that pb was way worse in game 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69
I thought he played a great villain , but I think that's because of his acting chops and not just being an actor . He did have some good lines though ! :D lt 3
I'm going to go with Papa John's . They're the best pizza in town , and they don't even use real cheese !
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic ... but I think that's a good idea !
I've seen a few of these guys at the beach , but I don't think it's legal for anyone else on this planet ... yet ! :D
I'm not sure what you mean by setting it to a different amount of heat , but I'll try that out and see if it helps ! Thanks for your help though :D lt 3
Can you please send it to me ? Thanks ! :D I'd love one too , thanks in advance !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I think it's pretty obvious that this is sarcasm .. ?
Neymar was a pro diver , he just didn t have any experience with diving and his dives were very risky because of that reason alone ...
I'm sorry for your loss !
I'm not stealing it . I just want to ride on the back of a bike that's been stolen before and is now in storage for some reason ...
Thank you ! I'm so glad to hear that :D It is definitely a bright spot in my day haha and thanks for noticing me glowy too lt 3
I think it was more of an oversight than anything . They could have easily done something like this with the other voice lines , but didn t do so ... ? :P
It's a lot of work but it pays off in the end ! I'm sure you'll get there eventually too if your perseverance continues to pay dividends ...
It's not that big but it is very large compared the US and Canada which are both much smaller than this one ...
What's the name of it ? I'm not sure what that is . Edit : Nevermind , found out ! r fatpeoplehate
I don't think anyone hates us , but I'm sure some people are just jealous of our Super Bowl win in 2012 !
It'll probably just end up being a bunch about how we're all gonna die and stuff ... I'm not even sure what that means but it sounds fun ! :D lt 3
A man with three fingers . A woman without one ...
I was going for a more of a surf boarder type thing . But I guess that's what you call it when your riding on a boat or something ... lol ! :D
I'm imagining a giant whale with an enormous head . It's pretty awesome , I think !
I think it's a young Michael Cera .
She was busy with a baby , I think she got distracted by it and forgot to come back later on in life ? Idk though ...
I think that was a good thing , I'm not sure why people are so against this game though ... It seems like they're trying to make something unique with their games .. ? :P Edit spelling error lolololoollooopsieeeeewwwwwwoooooohhhahahaahahhhaaawwaaaahhhhhhhhheeeeeyyyuhuuuughghgjkfkjdzvbqm 8nx xD
I'm sorry for your loss of life !
I'm glad you're still around . It's a great day to be alive ! :D
You're not . You can still get it at any time of the year if you have insurance and are in a country where there is no age restriction on vaccinations or treatments ! :D
I think he was the best player on that pitch . He had a great game !
I'm sure you'll be fine . I think we're all just going to have a good laugh at the end of this season , though ! :D
I'm sure they have some snakes that are just waiting for you ...
I'm sure they have a lot of people who would like some freedom from Chinese oppression !
He's a great actor , but I think he would be too busy being the voice of an old man in his mid 40s who is now dead and dying from cancer ...
I love the way his face looks when we're up by 20 and they are down 10 lolololloloooloo
I have not ! Thanks for the suggestion though :D
I'm not saying it's a good thing to eat at all but I don t think that the reason people are fat in general has anything do with their diet choices or lifestyle choice ... ? !
I think that might be a new feature for this map ... I'm not sure though :P But yeah ! That would make sense as well haha xD Thanks guys lt 3
We are up by 2 runs .
He was trying out for a job at Gale's . He wanted to get his name on it , but he didn't want anyone knowing that he wasn t actually there ... yet ! :P Edit spelling error ..
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling ... but I've never seen this happen before and it was only for me so far ! ?
I'm watching it in the UK and I don't have a TV subscription so no BBC coverage for me ! Thanks though mate :D Edit : spelling ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but I think it's funny that they would do this to make people laugh at them for being stupid and gullible ! :D DDDd ... wait .. what ?
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but it's actually pretty easy with an app like that ...
I have one of those , and it's great ! I've got the original Dreamcast game on my shelf right now ...
Because it's funny ? I don't know , maybe because they're trying out for the job or something ...
It's not that bad ... It just isn't funny at all ..
You're welcome . I'm glad to hear that your work has been well received !
He's not . He is just an actor who has been in the news for years and he doesn't have any real political experience or anything like that , so ... yeah ?
I'm not sure if that was a joke or not , but it made me laugh so hard ! :D Thanks for the chuckle though haha x3
I added you , but it says your friend code is not valid ?
I think it's more that he has a lot to prove . He was pretty good at Kentucky , but I don't see him being as dominant there again this year either ... yet ? ! lolololllll .. sighhhahahahaahhuhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeehee
I think that's a lion .
I'm not a fan . I think they're the best team in the East , but that's just my opinion and it doesn t mean anything to me personally lol !
I think it's the same guy . He has two different hats on , but they're all similar colors so I'm guessing that means one of them is an ultra or something ... lol ! :D
In all fairness tho global warming isn t really a thing either ... I mean it s not like he has any real power over the climate change debate or anything ! ?
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll . But I'll give it to the latter because that's what I've been playing for years now ! :D Thanks though man lt 3
I'm not sure if you've ever had the original but it is amazing ! The spicy chicken sandwich was my favorite thing in college so far this year ...
I think it was more like an awkward hug than anything else ... but I'm not sure what that means for his future career prospects either way ! Haha sorry to hear about your toe's though .. lt 3 hugs back
I'm not sure if that's what he was going for but I laughed . Thanks ! :D
I think the only reason they're not pulling more is because of Twitch's new deal , but that doesn't mean there aren t other reasons why viewership isn't up as much anymore ... right guys .. srsly ! :P Edit : words are hard lolololoolllllzzzzzZZZZs
I'm not sure how to answer this question honestly ... But it is very easy for me if you know the language of course ! :D
I'm sure you're not the only one . I was hoping for an award , but it's too late now ...
I'm not sure , but I know there was a lot about how they were going to adapt the LN's into an animated series or something like that ...
I've been watching that for like 3 months now and still haven't finished it , so good !
I have an iPhone 5s . I'm not going to be able too much longer , but thanks ! :D
He was sick and had to go home for his family's funeral , he said it on Twitter after that fight too !
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think the catapult is actually more powerful than the boomerang in this case because it's much larger and has an arc of fire ...
I think it's pretty much confirmed that there will be no parties in this game , but I'm not sure about how they'll work out yet ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad about this ... but it's true , they do leave holes in your skin and make them itch for days after ! :D Thanks though lt 3
Messi amp winning the Ballon D'Or .
I think he was more concerned with the fact it could cure his own disease and not others'diseases ... but I'm probably wrong about this one ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed now lolololllll
It looked like he got hit in the head . I think that's what they were saying on TV , but not sure if true or just speculation ...
I think it's more likely he had his camera pointed at him and just didn't want anyone else seeing .
I think he was saying that because of the way they were talking about it , not necessarily a bad thing to say in general ... but I could be wrong though ! lolololllll .. hahaahahahaha hahahahhaa
I don't think that's true at all ... I've never had an issue with my roommates having their own shower and not paying extra for it ?
I think you're missing the point of my comment ...
I'm not you , but if it helps ... yes !
Love your username , too :D lt 3
I'm sure you'll have a great time ! She's an awesome grandma too :D
I'm sure they have a lot of babies in their office ...
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I agree with your sentiment nonetheless ! :D
I'm pretty sure he was on his way to work when I read that ...
I think you mean hottest take .
It's a great beer ! It has the same taste as wine but with less of that sweet alcohol smell and more like honey or apple juice flavor than vanilla .
I'm a big fan of the one in the back , but I've never seen it there before !
It's not concrete . It's just some sort of stone , I think it might be marble or something ?
I would say that's a good idea . It will help you get used to it and make sure they don't fall off when trying new things ! Good luck on your project :D DDDdddeep ...
I'm not sure if that's good or bad . I think it was both , but mostly bad for us because we got him in return and he wasn't worth much more than that ... ? ! s
I'll be there . You can have a big mac , but you gotta pay me back for the fries !
He was trying for a rebound and got fouled on his way down so it's an automatic foul in this situation if you're going up for that dunk attempt anyway ...
I'm going to be so disappointed if it's true . I've been waiting for a good Star Wars film since Episode 1 and that was only 3 years ago ... sigh ..
I'm sure he'd be fine if it was on TV and not in front of his own people ... but I don't think they're going for him there either .. lol ! :D D: lt 3 u bbzkitties 1v1 me m8 ?
It's not about being a citizen , it is more so that they are able and willing to participate in elections without fear or prejudice from their government . It makes sense ... right guys .. srsly ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed upvote party !
I think she's trying to get her hand on his face . I'm not sure though , it looked like he just got up and walked away without saying anything ... maybe .. lol ! :D
I think you mean competitive games ...
I'm not sure if that's how much Peacocks grow in Texas . But yeah ... That would be an awful lot ! lolol Edit spelling error fixed typo correction
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I'll take it as a compliment !
I think it's a good thing . I'm sure there are plenty of people who would prefer to have their game load faster than that . It just takes some getting used too ! :P Edit : spelling ...
You're a good person !
I'm sure they'll just add another one to the list of things that will be removed from windows 8.1 and 9 ...
I think it was the other way around , but that would be pretty funny if true !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it's a joke about how deep your ocean can get in some places ...
I think you mean RB ... but yeah I agree with your point about WRs being gone too soon for us to have any hope of winning the division this season ! :D D: lt
I'd prefer to have the warmth of my own skin . I don't want to get sweaty and grossed out by all that heat ! :P
You're not alone in that confusion !
I'm so excited for this game ! It's going on my list of games that will never get old , and I can't wait until the day is over :D lt 3
Any links for the game ? I'm in Australia so it's not on TV here but would love a stream ! Thanks mate :D Edit : Nevermind found one below you guys'comments ... cheers anyway though man ..
I pay about 10 per day here ...
I'm pretty sure that's a myth , but I could totally see it happening !
I think it's going to be really bad . It looks like the worst thing ever made , and that is saying something because it was pretty decent in my opinion ! :D Edit : spelling error ...
It was . I think it's just the angle of her head that makes them look bigger than they are , but still small enough to be noticeable on TV anyway ! :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling but I think he's a great director and would be perfect for the role of Bond villain in this movie ! s Edit : spelling error fixed it
I'm sure they'd be fine with him going there . I mean if we're talking about a guy who's been in LA for 10 years then yeah that makes sense lol ! srs ?
I think he's got some vodka on him ...
I'm not sure if that's a typo or an intentional pun . Either way , good job ! :D
Welcome to the club ! We have a lot going on here at r chelseafc ... but you're welcome for your contributions as well :D
I'm down . Where do you want to meet up at ?
I think the first season is a lot better than 2 and 3 , but that's just my opinion though ! :D It has its moments too ...
I've been drinking it for years , and still don't like it ... but that's just me though ! :P
same same but different ... wait wrong sport !
He's a master at it , I tell you what ! He can make up anything he wants and still be right about everything else ... except for that one thing ..
I'm not a doctor , but I think it was more of an emergency situation than anything else ...
Yeah I was thinking about that but wanted to see if anyone else had done something similar before or after they took their pictures ! Thanks for your input though :D lt 3
I'm pretty sure I've been told this before .
I think it's more that the main character is named after an anime protagonist and not just some random guy who happens to be in this world ... ? :P
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I like it ! :D
You're not alone ! I'm so happy that this is a thing now , and it's only going up in value as more people learn about the art of flossing ... :D lt 3
It's a shame that it didn't happen in America , but I guess we can dream ... right ? Right guys ! Guys .. ?
I'm sure she's a great person , but I don't think that means what people say . She has no redeemable qualities and her husband was an awful human being too ...
It's a good thing he didn't do it then , because that would have been pretty bad for his health and well being ...
I'm not sure if this was a joke or not , but I laughed pretty hard at that one ! :D Thanks for making me laugh though haha x3 lt 3
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic but education has been improving in most developed nations since at least the mid 90s and it's still dropping dramatically here ...
I'm 25 , still look the same to me !

I'm pretty certain that's the point of it , to make you feel uneasy ...
I've seen a few videos where someone is carrying knives and it's not even close , but I don't think anyone has ever been seriously injured by one or two incidents like these ... yet .. lolololoolloli :D D: XD x DDXDDdxdxddxxyyyzzzsssdfgjhqwfk
I've heard it both ways !
From my perspective the dragons rule ! I am your father and you're not his son or daughter ...
He's not . He wants the Saudis out of power , but that doesn't mean they're a bad country or anything like it . They are just trying their best for America ! s
2016 was a lot of fun though !
I did , but I was too busy laughing at myself .
When you're playing against a ganker , it's not hard to tell if they are going for your lane or theirs ...
I'm not . I think it looks great !
I was going to say ... I'm sure the US is a lot more popular than it's ever had before .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but I think he was joking about the slow motion replay of that goal by his teammate in front him .. ? ! :D Edit : spelling error fixed hahaahahaahahhhaaayyyyeeeaaaahhhhhhhheeeeeaaaaaaaawwwwwwoooooohhhh
I think it's more that the feminist movement has been hijacked and turned into an echo chamber .
They're not flying , but rather just walking around like chickens do when you get close enough for them to see your footprints on ground level and stuff ...
They'll probably make a new one . They're not gonna do that with all of their movies , though ...
I've never had steak at any restaurant I have been to , but it's definitely not unheard of here either !
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but it was a joke .
I've never had a problem with them , I'm sure they're fine if you have one that doesn t mind waiting for your turn and then going back in line ... lol ! :D DD DDDddduuuuhhh .. XD x3 lt 3
She's a professional . She can afford it , and the other phone was probably stolen by someone else who didn't know how to use their own device properly ... or something like that ? ! s
I'm going to use this one from now on ! Thanks for the laugh , I needed that today lololollolo
I think it was a good call , but I'm not sure if the arm is in play or not ...
Thanks ! It's my first attempt at an abstract piece , so that means alot :D
You're not alone ! I've lived in both cities for years now ... it's pretty awesome here too haha :D
I'd rather have him as a color commentator for the game day crew than be an analyst or anything else . He has so much more experience and knowledge to offer ! s
Nekro is the best . He has so many cool abilities and his ulti makes him look like he could be an assassin !
And the other has been dead for years .
Fun fact , most home depots aren t even in the same state as me ! I live on a farm and have never seen one there before ...
I'm sure it's not his fault , but still ...
I have one of those too ... it's not that hard to get them in the states though .. just need some time and patience lolololloloooloo
I think the helmets have been pretty good this year , but I'm not sure about that one ...
I think it was more that his voice didn t fit with what we were hearing from the trailer and now we know why ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of the fact that they both have an affinity for bird law . I'll take it either way though ! :D lt 3
You're not alone . My parents gave me some nice , warm ones for my birthday and christmas eve ! They were so comfy too ...
I'd say he's a good manager but I don't think we need him . We have enough players to replace him with someone else at this point though ...
I do . I'm a software engineer and it's my dream to work in the industry that pays me well enough for what i want out of life ! :D DD
There are a lot of them , but they're not as prevalent . It's mostly the religious types who believe it is a disease and should be eradicated or something like this ...
I'm hoping for a female Predator . I'd love to see that movie , but I don't think they'll do one like this ...
I'm not sure what that means but I'll take it as a compliment ! :D Thanks for the laugh though haha xd lt 3
It's probably because he was in there for so long . He'll be fine , but it will take some getting used to !
I'm a fan of your username , but you're not my friend ! :P
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it was a joke ... ?
I'm not sure if this is an insult or not .
I'm pretty sure he knew grapes were fruits and not berries ... but I could be wrong about this one ! Edit : Grammar is hard sometimes lolololloloooloo
I'm sorry , but I don't think so .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say but I think it's pretty clear that he was being facetious ... ?
I think you mean Chapter 5 , but yeah ...
I think we're going to need a new manager soon if you don t mind me asking ...
I'm down for this . I think we can do it !
I think that's a girl , but I could be wrong ...
You're not alone , my friend ! :D
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but that's actually the best feature of waze for me ! It makes driving so much easier to navigate around cities etc ...
I'm sure they'll give you some sort if compensation , but I doubt it will be much more than the usual amount that's been given out in previous years ...
That's what I was thinking too !
I'm sure he's got some pretty good genetics . He probably has the best genes of all gorillas , and they're not even close in terms on strength or size either ! :D D: lt 3
I'm not sure if that's what he was going for , but it worked !
It's not like he was using his arms for anything else , though ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this ...
It's not like they're going to eat it . It'll be gone in seconds if you don't get them all out of their bag before hand ... or something .. I dunno man that sounds crazy lolololoolllllzzzzyyyy :D D: lt 3333
I'm not sure if that was intentional or just an accident ... but I laughed anyway ! Thanks for sharing this with me :D
I see a little bit of movement . It's not too bad though I guess it depends on your eyesight and how far away you are from the screen ...
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that someone got my reference ...
It's not you . It looks like a normal phone to me , but the picture makes it look flipped up . I'm guessing OP has some sort of weird camera angle setup ...
I'm glad you're enjoying it ! We've been through some tough times and we are finally getting back to our old selves again this year with the new coach . It's great stuff for us too ...
I'm sure that was a joke ... right ? Right guys .. ? Guys ! I think we're on to something here :D s
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I think it's funny that this is what happens when people don't watch F1 for more than 2 years ! :D D: lt
I'm pretty sure that's not true , but I could be wrong about this one ...
She was born with the power of love and it took her years to learn how to use that power properly ...
I'm not , but thanks for letting me know ! I'll check that out later today when i get home from work :D Thanks again matey lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun . I don t think she s that bad , but it is still pretty gross to me ...
I'm at 7 . I think it's a good one , but not great for me personally ...
I think you mean inside , but I'm not sure ...
I think it's a tie between ROTS and A New Hope for me personally but I'm not sure about that one ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... But it's true that they are very expensive pets !
He's a professional . He knows what he is and isn't going to do anything about it , but that doesn t mean you can just ignore him like this ...
I'm hoping for a new sonic game in the future !
I would recommend overwatch and hearthstone if you want to play a MOBA with heroes that are not in the same genre as dota 2 :D
They'll just send them to the camps . They're not going anywhere !
I think it's a reference to the song , but yeah that one too lol !
You're hired ! I'm going to be the guy who gets all of these things .
I think it's a new policy , but I'm not sure if that means you can't use it for Marriott hotels ? Or is there some other way around this ? Thanks ! Edit : spelling error fixed ..
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... I hope this is sarcasm because that would make me laugh so hard ! Haha ..
It was , I'm glad someone else got to experience this ! It really does make me want more and better things ...
That s great ! Thank you for sharing your story with us all so far . It is very encouraging .
I remember the days of Disc priest and Holy Paladin ...
Because they're not going anywhere else for the next 10 years or so ...
It's a good thing I'm not in charge of hiring people then ! :P But yeah , that would be my guess as well ...
I think it means that the triangle is a reference to something . Like , I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but either way :P
I'm sure I'll get a better ending than this one ...
I'm not even that young and I've been around since the 80s ! :D
I'm not , but I do have a few friends who are and they're pretty grossed out by it too ... so that's probably why ! :P lolololloloooloo
I'm sure it's not the only thing leaking , but yeah ... It definitely isn't something you'd want to keep secret from your boss or coworkers either way lolololoolllll :P Edit : spelling
I have about 40 hours in and haven t even finished Chapter 1 yet ... :P
They don't , but the US does have a system of public voting that is used by many countries to determine their national identity and political affiliation ...
They're about as big or bigger than my hand , but not nearly that large in diameter and much smaller on top . They can be quite intimidating when you get close though ... lol :P hahaaha XD xD lt 3
They're not afraid , they just don't want to get hit .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that they're finally showing them , but it is nice to see some of my favorite films again ! :D Thanks for reminding me though ... lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwwwaaaaaaahhhahahaha XD lt 3
It's a great video , I highly recommend it !
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this ...
They got a pick 6 and then the refs called back for holding on that play , so they had no timeouts left in OT with 2 minutes remaining at half ...
It is a great piece of art , but I think the fact that he has so many pieces to choose from makes me want him more than anything else ...
I don't know , but it's a good idea . She is one of my favorite characters and I want more variety in how people play with her ! :D DD
He's a medic main and it wasn't his fault at all ...
I'm not sure if I've ever seen a show with such an amazing cast as House of Cards , but it's definitely one to watch out for !
I have , but it didn't work . I'm not sure what to do now ...
I'd rather not . I'm a little scared to get back in my seat now ...
I've had dogs do this before , too ! I think it's just instinctual for them that you are there so they can get out of your way if needed ... ? :P Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolololoolllll
Yeah , I'm not sure why he's still on IR ... but it seems like a good idea to keep him off of that list for now until we know more about his injury status ? ! srsly .. lolololoolllllooooooowwwwwwwweeeeelloooooloooooooooohhhahahahaha
I think it's just regular ol'beef . I've never had Al Fajardo , but the recipe is pretty similar to what you'd find at most Mexican restaurants in Texas and Florida ...
I think the first one was just me being lazy , but I'll keep that in mind for future videos ! Thanks man :D lt 3
I'm sure they'll be fine , but I'd like to see a video or something showing how it's done in action before buying one ...
I think you mean , the cat knows everything about nap time and it's just a matter of preference for some people ...
Pimentos in the UK ? ! That's new for me ...
It's a reference to the movie The Prestige where Michael Fassbender plays Bond in an alternate universe where he is actually a woman .
I loved his character . He was a great actor and he had some of the best lines ever written for a movie .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but the only reason why people like me are still drinking whisky after 30 years of age is because they can afford it ! :D D: dddd ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll . Either way it's funny and makes me laugh every time !
I got him in my last pack . I'm not sure if he's worth it though , but his stats are pretty good for me so far !
I think he was just trying to get out of paying taxes for his campaign contributions ... which were probably paid by foreign entities anyway .. so yeah I don't see that happening either way lol ! :P sryyyy lt 3 u bbzkappa ?
I love them . I'm not sure why , but they're fun to watch !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but I laughed pretty hard at this one ! Have my upvote sir madam :D DDDd ...
I think he's saying that it was his fault , not theirs ... but I could see how you'd interpret this as him blaming them for something they didn't do themselves .. lol :P Edit spelling error fixed now hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
I think he was referring to the fact that there are no real rules , but rather guidelines and regulations for how you can behave within society .
I'm in the same boat as you guys ... but at least tomorrow will be over by noon or so :D
I'm from England and we use Grays for everything except Grey or Gray as an adjective . It is also used to refer specifically to people who have gray hair .
It's definitely worth it , but you'll have to be very careful with your finances if you want the best job opportunities in town for sure ! Good luck on applying though :D lt 3
I'm not sure if I should be impressed or horrified by this , but either way its pretty cool to see in person :D Thanks for sharing OP lt 3
I'm going through the same thing right now ! I've been trying so hard but it's not working ...
I'm sure the judge would have found him guilty , but it's not like they're going to be able too much longer anyway ...
I think it's more of an advertisement for the game . It looks like something you'd see on TV or in magazines , but not Minecraft itself ...
It's on there . I just didn't include it because that would be too much effort for me to do in one day and then forget about it later lol ! :P
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take your word for it ! :D Cheers matey lt 3
I think he's a great coach , but his team is just so bad that it makes you hate them even more than before ... and then there are the fans who love em ! :D D: lt 3
I think she's a good candidate for mayor and I'm not sure why people don't like her so much ? She seems to be doing well in Toronto ! s Edit : spelling error fixed it
I think you mean'Play with me and my friends ' ?
It's a bot that automatically posts the top comment from r all every time someone says something about this sub or its mods in some way shape and form ...
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I agree with your sentiment nonetheless ! :D
They do , but they're not very active and don't really care about it as much anymore since the new system is in place for them now :P
I'm sure you're not being paid to do that , but I'd be happy if my boss did it for me too ! :D
I'm sure you do too but this isn't a new thing in France ... It was pretty much always going on for decades before Hollande got elected ..
I think you mean Niggle , not Nigga ...
I'll take one .
I'm sure they're great ! I just don't know if it's worth the money to get them all , especially since you can buy a lot of other stuff for less ... ? :P lololollolo
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is happening now ... but it's definitely more stress than fun for me right about now lol :P Thanks though lt 3333
I've been doing it since I was 16 . It's not too bad , but the car is pretty heavy and has to be driven in reverse .
Yeah , but you can't hear your own voice over the TV unless it's plugged in to the headset or something like that ...
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I've never had an issue with my doors being locked or anything like this before ... ?
I'm not sure what you're asking . I don't think it's racist , but if someone says something like that they are probably being disrespectful towards people who do say it ...
I think that's the record for most forests burned in one year , not just fires but also forested areas .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious . Either way , it was a great play by him and he's earned his spot in this league !
He's not . He was just being sarcastic , and I think it got lost on some people who didn't get what you were saying ...
I'm sorry , I don't understand what you're trying to say here ...
They did , but it was a prequel and not an expansion or sequel . It's still technically Fallout 3 .
I think it was more of an ironic thing to say , but yeah ...
I think it's a great idea , but there are better ways to catch .
I'm sure he was just being sarcastic , but I think it's funny that you're downvoted because people are so sensitive about the subject matter here ...
I think you mean Dr . Strangelove , but yeah that would be pretty awesome ! I'd love for it not just being an animated film though ...
I'm sure they will . I just hope it's not a full refund , because that would be ridiculous ! :P But yeah ... I agree with you on that one ..
I'm going with you on this one .
I love that song , but I think it's more about how they're not really friends anymore than anything else ...
You're not alone , friend !
A turtle !
I'm sure they would have made a deal with the publisher for that , but I doubt there was any money involved in this game's development or release date ...
I think it was more that they wanted to make him an animated character , but not necessarily the main focus of their films anymore ... which would be cool too ! :D Edit spelling error .. lolololoolloliogloooooohhhahahaahahhhaaawwwwaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhheeeeeeellooooooooooowwwwaaaaghhhhhhuhuuuughghgjehueeeewwhooooshiiiiiieeeeyyyyayouuuuu
It's on my list ! I'm excited for it , but the trailer looks so bad ... :P Thanks though lt 3
I think that's what they call themselves in Canada .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this . It's a good idea but it doesn't seem like something that would work out well for anyone involved ... :P Edit : spelling error ! D: lt 3
I think it's a lot more than four . It could be as high at least 5 million , but probably not even close to five billion dollars worth of bitcoins in circulation right now ! s
I think it's a great way for them both to be more relatable , but I'm not sure if that means they're going in another direction or what ... ? ! :D
It's a joke about how people think that salt causes cancer , but it doesn't and therefore isn t harmful to humans at all ...
They have a better chance of winning the game than TSM . They also had more points in their first match against CLG.EU , so they are probably favored by now too ...
I use a mixture of both . I don't think it's necessary , but if you want to try something different then go for it !
He's been pretty good at it this year , but I think the problem is his shot selection and decision making are not consistent enough to be considered reliable shooters anymore ...
I know . I was just saying it's a good stat to have for the guy who won't be playing in college next year haha !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling . I've never seen a player get so much armor in one game as he did this season ...
I'm pretty sure he has a lot of those in him ...
I think it's a good thing . They're not getting the ball back and they can't get away with anything anymore , so there is no reason to be mad at them now ! :D DD
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think that's a pretty good comparison to what we have today in terms of entertainment value ! :D Thanks for sharing though ...
The economy will be fine . The problem was that it wasn't , and now we're in one again with no end goal for our country's future ...
I'm at work and it's still going on ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I think it's a reference to The Matrix .
I'm not sure if you're joking or serious . But that's awesome and a great way to get some more people involved in this project :D Thanks for your help though ! lt 3
I think you mean best , but I agree with your sentiment nonetheless !
Not me . I'm on my phone and don't use it much anymore , but if you're a fan of the show or just want to follow them for some reason then go ahead ! :D lt 3
I'm a fan of this idea as well ...
And cockroaches !
I'm sure he's a great guy , but I don't think that means much to him if his parents didn t raise and train the kid well enough for this kind behavior ... ? ! s Edit : grammar
I'm sure she's proud too . She has to have some sort if pride in her childhood right now ... or something like that ..
A beer , a knife ... A shovel !
I do ! I'll be on the lookout for ya , buddy :D
I'm not sure what this means but I like it ! Thanks for sharing your wisdom with me .
I think you mean , ' aw yeah ! ' .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take it either way !
I think it was a little kid , but I could be wrong !
I'm sorry to hear that man ... hope you're doing well !
I'm 26 ... so close ! :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but that was the name for one of my ships in EVE Online ...
I'm not sure if that's an actual quote from Star Wars or just something they said in one episode ... but it sounds pretty cool so go ahead and use it for your own purposes .. lol jk lt 3 u bbz 2ndhandsmokeyface.jpg xD XD D:
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this was the first time someone has made me laugh out loud on a thread like this ...
I'm glad you liked it ! I was going to make a new one but then the game crashed and now my computer is dead ... :P
I'm sure they'll be able to find a way around that ...
I'm a woman and have never gotten more than 1 or 2 girls in my life ... so yeah .. it's possible ! :D
I think it's more of a reflex , but yeah ...
I've been playing since launch and I haven't seen any toxicity at all ... yet ! :D
I'm sure they're all on their way now ...
I thought that was an actual picture at first , but then realized there is no way to tell if its real or not without seeing it in person ...
I think you're right on all of those except for the last one ... but I'll take it ! Thanks a lot man !
I think he's a great guy and his character is really interesting ! He was my favorite in the first season so far too :D
I think he means the texture of the meat .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but it's pronounced GIF in this context and is also used as an acronym for Graphics Interchange Format .
You're not alone , friend !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a joke but that's actually what he said in an interview with Conan O'Brien on SNL last year ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of my username ... but that's actually pretty funny ! :D
I'm sure she's not going anywhere near that .
You're not , but you are correct that we haven t had one in the first half of this game !
I think he's still in it , but I don't know if they're going to use his character for anything else now ... or maybe just a cameo ? ! :D Edit : spelling error fixed .. thanks u jonnymatthewson 1
Awesome , I'll have a look around there then :D Thanks for sharing your experience with us all and thanks again for being awesome people who do this kind thing ...
I'm pretty sure that was a joke .
That's a good idea . I'll do that ! Thanks for the tip , man :D
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I think it was a joke but he did say something like that in an interview with NPR last year ... maybe .. lol ! :P Edit spelling error hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
I think Dee is also a teacher , so she could be his wife or something like that ?
I think the point is that there are a lot of things in this game , but not all of them need fixing .
I'm not 100 but it sounds more like he's just trolling and trying to get attention for his blog post , which has been removed from r funny because ... well .. you know ?
I'm not sure if I should be offended or happy . :P But thanks for your input !
He's gonna be a real hero !
I do this too ! I'm not sure why but it's just so much fun to play with my friends who are newbies or people that don't know how to use their mic ... lol :D D: lt 3
I'm sorry about that : c but i will delete the comment now xD thanks anyway though D:
Minions are the best ! :D
I'm a girl and I have no idea what you're talking about ... but that's pretty funny ! :D
I'm sure you'll get the game eventually ! It's just that there are so many games out right now ...
I still play that game ... I'm not sure why though .. maybe because of the nostalgia ? :P It's just so good !
He's also a pretty good actor , I think his role was more of an homage than anything else though ...
I think it's the lighting and angle of her head that makes them look smaller in person ! I'm not sure though ... maybe they're just really tiny ? :P lolololllll XD xD lt 3333
I've been doing this since the beginning of my job , but now that you mention it ... I think we're all INTPs here :P
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I don t think it s possible for me or anyone else in the world to do so without being banned from here ... sorry :P Edit spelling error fixed now lolz xD lt 3 u bbbyyyy
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I think it's a joke about the fact that they have to review every single penalty called against them by UEFA and FIFA officials ? ! s
I'm using the one that came with my Xbox . I don't know if it's a good idea to try and play online though , because of all these hackers ! :P lolololloloooloo
Then they're not panning aluminum ... They're just using a different material to make the dishwasher safe and sanitary for your home kitchen environment ! s
It's more along the lines if you're going to be pedantic , it should have been called an elaborate prank .
He's going for the hat trick record now ...
Same here , but that game is over now so ...
That would be great ! Thank You so much , that'd really help me out a lot :D lt 3
I think that's the first time I've ever seen someone say this , but it really does make sense in context of what he was saying ...
I'm sure they're not going to be cheap . They'll probably cost more because it's a lot harder for people with money or jobs that can afford this technology , though ... s ? I hope so anyway ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed ..
I loved Angry Birds ! I'm glad it's not dead yet ... but yeah that was a long time ago for me too lol :P Still fun though haha ..
I'm still working through it , but I've been doing a lot of mythril farming so far ! :D
I'm sure they'll be back in a few years when Netflix has their own version of it and people start to complain about how bad netflix is compared with cable or satellite ... wait .. nevermind ! :P
I'm with you on that one , I've been drinking since the first episode and it's still going strong !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but it's a quote from The Office .
It was a good movie but the writing in that film wasn't great at all ...
I'm not sure what you're talking about . I've never seen anyone get so upset over something as trivial and insignificant that they have no idea how it happened ... ? ! s
It's a great car , and it has an amazing interior ! It also looks like a toyota corolla with that roof rack thingy on top of the hood ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trying to be funny ... but it's probably both ? Edit : Oh my god thank you so much everyone who downvoted me lt 3
I was going to say the same thing , I have one and it's gorgeous as well :D
I'm not sure . I've been looking for one of these since the beginning , but no luck yet ! Thanks though :D
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this comment ...
I think it's more likely they will do something like Fallout 3 ' s DLC , where you can play as one of your companions or whatever in multiplayer mode ... but I could see this happening too ! lolololoolllll .. XD xD lt 333333xdddoooooOOOoooohhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmnnnngggzzzZZZoooooooooooorrrrrssss ? Zorrtttaaaaaaahhhhhrgghwaaaaw
I think it was just an animation glitch . He didn't actually do that move , but he did get knocked down and then rolled back up to block damage from his opponent's attacks ...
Squidward is an octopus , not squidman ! Squid man's bones are in his mouth ...
I think you mean she got her own little pet .
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling ... but I laughed pretty hard at this one ! :D Thanks for that !
NK is not a country . It's an island surrounded by water , land or sea that has been controlled for decades now .
It's not , but the point was that you can't watch it online without paying for cable or satellite channels .
I'm not sure if he's a threat to anyone , but it would certainly make him more dangerous .
I think he was a little too young when that happened , but I'm not sure about the age of consent in those days ...
That sounds amazing :D I'm going to try that next year when it gets warmer out here haha thanks for sharing your experience with me lt 3
You can't . They're just there for fun , they don t have any real purpose in the game other than being a challenge or something like that ...
Because it's not true . The Warriors are favored in every single one of these games and they're winning them all by 20 points or less ...
It's a good thing I have my own sock !
I'm so glad I saw this movie when i did ! She's amazing in that role as well ...
I think you mean West Mid , not Best East ADC ...
You're a good person . You should be able to do all of those things without any trouble at all !
r politics for me . I'm a mod there so it gets pretty serious sometimes but the mods have been great to us over at r legaladsciences !
I think they're talking about the original series , not this one that's been cancelled for a while and is being revived as an anime .
I think he's been hitting the ground too much lately , but I'm not sure if that was intentional or just an accident ...
I think it's because of how much they were hyped up , but I agree that this was pretty disappointing for both teams in terms if preparation .
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I'll take your word for it because if so then yes ! That's exactly why they're called artificial diamond blocks instead of natural ones ... lololollolooolooohhhahahahaahhhaaaaahhhhhhhh haaaaaaaaalllloooooowwwwwwwweeeeellooooonnnnnggggghjkuhuuuugglssssttttfffffffffccckkkbbb
They're not that bad , but they have a lot of bandwagoners who don't know what to do with their lives and just want to see something good happen for them ...
I'm not sure if that's true , but I've heard it from a few people and they say it works like this : If you spend 100 dollars on something ... You lose 200 !
I'm not saying it matters , but if you're going for the first pick in a draft then your best bet is probably taking one of those guys at 5th overall ... lololollolo ! s
I know that but I was wondering if they were actually good or just a lot better than everyone else ?
I think you mean that we are a planetoid .
I agree . The Balkan countries were a lot more stable under Tito than they are now after his regime was overthrown by Yeltsin in 1991 .
Happy bday ! I hope you enjoy it . It's a great game that has been around for years now but still holds up well today in modern games like this one too .. lolololoolllll XD xdxdxdd
You're not alone .
Am also a human being , am not crazy at all ! I'm just really into horses and their stories ...
I've never heard of that . I'll have a look into it ! Thanks for your help matey :D
I'm hoping it's just an expansion pack for NV and not something new to Fallout 3 or NV :P I'd love some more content in that game though ...
I'm having a great time , it was my first day of school in two weeks :D
He didn't , Bottas had a good start and then lost the race due to his car being too slow for Ham's strategy . He got lucky though ! :D DDDDdddeeppppffffffftttt ...
I'm sorry to hear that ! I hope you find a good one soon :D lt 3
I'm sorry to hear that ! I hope you find a good one soon :D lt 3
I'm sorry to hear that ! I hope you find a good one soon :D lt 3
I'd like a new manager . I think we're in for one soon though !
I'm not a fan , but it does have its place in my house for sure ! :D And yes that sounds amazing as well ...
Not until the main event of this card , but it's still on my list to watch for sure if I can't find anything else tonight or tomorrow night ... lolz .. hahaahahaahahaaaahhhaa haaaaaaaaaggggghhhheeeehee heeeeeehhhhhhhh
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of the name ... but I'll take your word for that one ! Thanks though lolololo
I'm not sure what you mean ? I've never had any problems with my friends and family who play Minecraft ...
I think there's only one park in the entire country that has a larger population than the city of Chicago , and it is called The City Park .
I think that's what happened to me with The Big Lebowski , but I don't remember which scene ...
I think he's a great player , but I don't hate Baker man ... He just doesn t have what it takes for NFL success like Embry does or Ramsey has had in college football .. lol ! ?
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
He's also got an injury history , so that probably helps him out too much in terms of money and exposure to competition as well ...
I'm sure he'll be happy for you . hugs back at ya ! :D lt 3
I'm sorry for your loss ... but I don't think that's what he was going through at the time of his death either .. ?
I'm pretty sure it was more than just friendship , though ...
I think you mean offensive .
I think he meant air marshals , but I'm not sure either way ...
I'm so sorry for your loss , man ...
You can't , it's just an error on the website that was made by someone who didn t know how to use google translate or something like this ...
I've got a few of them , but they're all from the same game ...
When you're in your 20s and don't know what to do with it .
I'm not sure if this applies to the UK or Canada ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I hope it's sarcasm , because that would be hilarious ! :D But seriously ... It does give a similar feel to my feelings about this post .. lolololloloooloo lt 3333
I think it's going to be either Matt Barkley or Trevor Knight . I'm not sure which one is better though ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but I think the guy is a troll and he's trying to make people believe that this isn t true ... ? ! s
I've never seen one of those , but they exist everywhere else ? Where do you live that it is common to see them at all times ?
I think you mean the boxes are full and filled up with junk food ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll ... But that sounds like something an American would say !
We're not that bad . We just don't win enough games for them , and they are a good team so it's hard to hate us as much anymore :P Edit spelling error fixed now lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwww
He was , but it wasn't a clear path . He had to be outside of his line and there were no blockers around him so I guess they didn t call anything ... lol ! :D sry for bad english ..
I think this is what I'm going for . Thanks !
I think he's just trying not to cry ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling but that's an awful comparison to make ...
I'm hoping for a sequel where they go back in time and get the original cast together again !
First President of America , not First White President ...
I'm not even mad . That's hilarious ! :D
I'm a support main but I've been playing as an assassin for awhile now so that's what i'll be doing this season ! Thanks man :D lt 3
I've found a few things there but I don't think they're worth it for me to keep them around :P Thanks though !
I think you mean the Gatorade , but yes ... I'm pretty sure there's one or two around here too ..
I'm glad you're not the father . I'd be worried about him if that was me ! Haha , thanks for sharing your story though :D lt 3
They could if the police were there . But that's not what happened in this case ...
Chippies are great !
I thought that too , but then again the title is a bit misleading ...
I'm pretty sure that's a lie and I've never heard of it before ... but if so then why would they have to be in court ?
I'm sure that was the joke ...
I'm not 100 , but I think it's a boy .
I'm American and I don't care about soccer , but that was pretty funny ...
I'm not sure if I should be impressed or horrified that this is real ...
I'm sure they're not going for the same thing as Hillary did with her emails ... but I guess we'll see how it plays out in a few months ! s ?
He's not a smart man . He doesn t understand how much money he s making from his businesses , or what it means for him personally if they are successful enough ...
I'm sure you'll be fine . The trains are pretty much the only thing that's going down there anyway so it shouldn t really matter too much for them anyways ! :P PPPpffffftttt ...
I think that was a joke on how people would complain if something like that happened again after being able to see what items were available for purchase .. :P I hope not ! lololollolooolooohhahahaahahaaaahhhhaaheeeehee heeeeeehoooooooowwwwwwewwaaaaaaaattttiiiiiennnnnnggggghhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmppssszzzoooooooooogawyyyuuuughuhm
I was thinking the same thing ! I think it might be her hair , but she looks like ET to me too ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think that's the point ...
The episode where he was on a boat with his mom and dad , but then she died ...
I'd be like , oh no ! We're going to lose again ? Well then ...
He said he was going for a more traditional look , but I'm not sure if that means it'll work out well or not ...
I'm not a fan , but I've had some that were pretty good and the flavor was really strong for what they are !
I've never had a cucumber slice that wasn't delicious ! I'm going for the whole family this year so we'll see how it goes :D Thanks ! lt 3
I'm sorry for your loss , but I hope you're doing well ! hugs and kisses from a stranger on the internet lt 3
I think you mean'I'm gonna make this into an animated film , called'Undefeated ' '
It's not fun . I'm sorry you have to deal with this , but at least we're in the same division as them now !
I'm sure they have a lot of other ways , but this one's pretty good for now !
I think it was the first time he's ever done this , and I'm pretty sure they were both on his own team at one point or another ... so yeah crazy ! :D Edit : spelling error fixed lolololoollllloolooowwwwwwoooooohhhahahaahahhhaaawwaaaahhhhhhhhaaaaaaaayyyyeeeewooooooooooooshiiiiiieeeeeehheuhuughuuuchtttsss
I'm from Mississippi and we say State , but it's not a common thing to do here either ...
That's not really what I'm looking at though ...
You're not alone , brother ! We've been waiting this long too ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll . But I like the idea of this sub being about fashion and not politics ! :D
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this is my first thought when reading your comment ... edit :P Edit 2
done , upvote my post and i will return it to u asap :D thx for the help
I am 31 , but it's been almost 10 years since I've had one of those !
I think that's a good question . I'm not sure if they're still in production or what but there was one with them and some other stuff like this ...
It's the little toes that do it to you , isn't it ?
I think she was just too busy with the other two , and not to notice that they were there ... or maybe it's because I'm a woman ? :P Edit : Spelling !
It's a good trick , but it doesn't work on me ! I'm not very smart ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic . I'll just say that the first step in fixing a problem is to turn your computer back on ...
I'm already on the edge . I can't wait ! :D
I think you mean blunt man amp chronic ...
I was thinking the same thing ! I think it's her , but she looks nothing alike ...
Root for a tie .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious but I think it's just a Korean thing to do that they don't like the announcers ...
I'm not a demacian . I just like that quote and wanted it in my flair :P But yeah you're right about me being an outsider haha xD Thanks for reminding me though lt 3
I like the new album by The National from last year ! It was pretty good too :D
I'm not sure what the requirements are , but I know that it's possible . It depends on your field and how much time you have available for study .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but it's funny that people think this is an actual thing and then act surprised when it happens to them ... lol ! :D D: lt 3
I think we're going to try for him , he was our best player last year so I'm hoping it works out well !
I'm not sure if you're serious , because that was the first thing in this thread ... But it does make sense ! :D Thanks for your input though lt 3
Because it's a good idea and we're not doing anything about this problem , so why shouldn't they do something about it too ! s
I think they're just trying to get a good view .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I think it's funny either way , so upvote for ya :D
They did , but it was a few days before launch so everyone knew who to call in for an update on their phones or tablets etc ...
I think they are worried about a lot more than just stability , but I agree with you on energy and climate change being very important issues right now ! :D Edit spelling ...
I'm pretty sure the guy who was eating his own head had more of an impact on how well he did as a fighter , though ...
I'm not sure if I should be scared or excited that this movie exists ...
I think they're ranked in the top 25 , but I don't know how much of that is due to their defense or offense though ...
I think it's the lighting , I can't see any of that stuff in this picture ...
I thought it was going to be him getting shot by his own teammate , but I guess not ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll . Either way I laughed at your comment and upvoted it for the sake of comedy ! :D
I think it's the guy in black .
I think the point is that they're talking about how much of a joke this was back then and now . It's just an interesting fact to have on record ! s
I'm sure you could still do that today if your phone had an autocorrect function built into its keyboard ...
He's a hero . He is the hero of football , and he will be remembered for centuries by all who remember him as such ...
I'm a German and it's 11pm for me , so ... yeah ? :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but I'll take a stab at it : We should just get him there !
Craig is a great host , he's just not funny anymore imo ...
I've never had a wet wipe with any kind of branding on it and I have no idea what you're talking about ... ?
I think aphro is a better mid than bang . He's more consistent and has the potential to be even higher in challenger scene , but he lacks experience atm imo ... :P ! xD lt 3
I think he's just a really good actor . He has some of his best performances in movies and TV shows , but not on screen time like that guy does ...
I think it's a toss up between Kearse and Baldwin for me personally but I'm biased towards the latter because he was drafted in my hometown !
You can't . They're all dead and gone forever , but you still have the memories of them in your head !
I think he had a lot of pressure , just not enough to be able too much damage in lane without dying . He did well though !
You did ! Thank You so much . :D lt 3
I think he just didn't want people thinking it was a typo and that they were talking about his real surname , which is what I thought at first too ... but yeah ..
He did have a daughter though , so that counts for something right ? Right guys ! Guys .. I think we're done here boys .
It's a good thing they didn't make the same mistake as with Star Wars then ...
He's the best at what he does and it seems like we're going in that direction with him as well !
And if I don't see my way out of this world , then what is life without me !
I'm sure he does it to get the job done ... but I don t think so because of all those other reasons why not !
It's going to be like that whole Star Wars thing , but in space !
I'm going to use this . Thank you ! :D
I think it was more of a case for Kyrie . He's been playing great lately and he has to be in this game , right ? Right guys ... Guys .. ? ! s
I'm going to go with the same thing . If we win , then there's no way they can lose this game ... right guys .. ? Guys ? Anyone want some peanut butter or something ?
I think it was a joke about how his name is spelled in Spanish and not English ... I could be wrong though ! :P
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . Either way , it's a good thing we have the internet to tell us when someone isn't joking around ... right ? Right guys .. ? Guys ?
I think he was trying to get the ball back . He didn't touch it before that though , so I don t know what happened there ... but yeah you re right !
I'm sure they're just for the kids , but I'd still buy them if it was a good deal ! :D
I'm sure that's what they'd say if someone tried this at their house ...
I think you mean the Kardashians are smart people who know how to use social media well enough for their own good ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious . I think it's a good thing that they have to be so emotional about their job , though ! It makes them more interesting ... ? :P Edit : grammar
I'm pretty confident that the French will be able too beat you guys in a friendly at some point this season ... I think it's going to happen anyway though :P Edit spelling error .. sorry folks D: lt 3
That's the dream !
I think you guys are going to win . I'm not sure though ...
I think he's just hungry . He looks so happy !
They're not dead until the blood starts flowing out of their brain and into a different body . Then it's time for them to go home !
I have a dog who does this all of the time , and he's always trying to get his paws on me when they're cold ...
Jesus was just saying that he would have been better off not being born at all and letting people do what they want with their lives instead of following God's commandments ! s
The Room . I was so disappointed when it came out and then they made a sequel that wasn't as good , but still had some great moments !
Definitly would be better . It's just too early for me to type that out right now :P I'm sure there are plenty of people who can't read the time difference though ! Haha sorry about your day mate .. lol XD xD lt 3
I'd pay for that PPV !
I think he was blind before his powers were even activated though ? I could be wrong but that seems like a pretty big oversight on their part ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I hope this is the case though ! :D
He's gonna say something like , You're not a real champion until you've won your title in WWE ! or whatever it is that they call him now ...
I think he's a little too high to be in there , but that would have been an awesome scene if they had him on the floor ! :D
I'm sure they're not , but it's still a good idea for people who want more information on their operators and don't have access yet ! :D DD
I think it's a good trade for both teams . I'm not sure how much the Cavs would get in return though ...
I'm sure they'd be all over it if he was a republican or democrat ... but I don't think so ..
I'm not a biscuit , I don't eat them !
He's a Rams fan , he knows what to do when they're down by 20 and it looks like we have an easy time scoring touchdowns ...
I'm going through my rewatch right now and this is still one of mine that sticks out in terms if memory serves me correctly ! It's a great movie though ...
I'm sure he's a great cook and would have eaten all of them if they were in there !
Extra Time .
I'm sure he's fine , but I think it would be a good idea to check the floor for debris before you do anything like that ... especially if there is no damage ! :P Thanks though ..
I think it's two now ... but yeah that would probably work too lolololoolllll
They'll probably have it in flashbacks , but I'm not sure about full episodes yet ... maybe next year ! :D
I've been on Whatsapp for years and never had a problem with it ...
I'm not sure what the point of this comment is , but I agree with it anyway !
I'm not sure , but I think the title is misleading . It's just an article about how she was in bed with Russia and that they were spying for her emails ! s
The French and losing to Germany .
I thought it was just me . I've never had an issue with ordering anything over here , but that doesn t mean they don t have problems in other countries ! :D lt 3 u britishproblems
I'm sorry , but she's not interested in me anymore ...
Yes please ! Thanks so much for the offer , but I'm going to pass on it now because of my work schedule and such :P Thank you though lt 3
I've never had one , but I'm sure it's delicious .
I think you mean , They're not going anywhere !
They're not , they were nominated for best picture and screenplay in their respective categories but won't be eligible to win any awards because it's a drama .
I'm one of them !
I think they were trying to get the enemy team into their jungle . They didn't want them getting caught out and dying , so it's understandable why he wasn t picked . sry for bad joke ... ? ! xD lt 3
I think the fact that they're all in a row makes them appear to be real , but I could see how someone would mistake one for another if you were looking at their faces ! lol jk haha XD xD lt 3 u bbzzzzzZZZTUHxXdEwLlNgKsRqhYyF XDDddrPssSrsMvBQeVnJWc 9aGm8u7
I think it's the hair . It looks so unnatural and out there for a guy that age ... I'm not sure if he was born with or without it though .. ? ! :P lolololloloooloo
He's a good player , but he doesn't seem to be very consistent . He has been playing well lately though !
I'm not sure what you're asking . I don't know her personally but it's possible ! She was a little bit older than me though so maybe there were some issues with the staph infection ... hmm .. lolololoolllll :P lt 3
I'm hoping that the new canon is better than what we got in TCW and Rebels so far ... but it's not looking good at all right now !
They're all British . They just don't know it yet , but they'll soon !
I'm pretty sure he is a big fan , but I don't think it would be fair to call him an athlete or anything like that ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I'll just say it's a reference to the movie The Crow , which is about a serial killer who murders people for money and candy ! :D D: lt 3
I'm not sure . I think it's more likely that the Russians are just trying to get their hands on some of our secrets and we don t want them here ! s
It's the eyes , man ! It is the eyes ...
I'm guessing a teaser for the next episode . I think it's going to be about how he got his powers , or something like that ...
I'm not sure if I want that or just one of those 2 discs , but thanks !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but he was a good president and would have been an excellent choice for President in 2020 . He just didn t fit into that mold unfortunately .. :P Edit spelling error lolololoollllloooooowwwwwwoooohhhoooshhhhhhahahahaha XD xD ltppp
I'm from Sweden too ! I love it when they have the banana in there with everything else :D
And my axe . Wait , wrong game ? :P
Zlatan is not going anywhere anytime soon and he's a great player so I don t think it would be an issue if they did want him gone ... but maybe next summer ! s
They're going to be pretty bad , but I think they'll look good on TV and at home with their new costumes !
I don't think so . I'm not sure what to do with my new flair though , but it's a good idea for future reference ! Thanks ! :D Edit : Changed it back now ...
Or just use the fireplace to make charcoal and then burn it in your house , which is what I do now when cooking with my stovetop oven ...
I think he was better than Rekkles in that game but I agree with you on Bresh and his Lee Sin play ! He played really well today too :D Edit spelling mistake ...
I'm not sure we're even close to being a good team , but I think it's safe for now and let them play their game in conference games first before worrying about us ... ? ! s
It was a great movie !
I'm pretty sure you could burn a baby in the middle of an open field , but that's just my opinion on how to do this ...
I'm a 90 ' s baby . I don't know what you're talking about , but it's not my fault ! :P
It's still a good thing though , right ? I mean it was never really about the quality of players but rather how they performed in their respective leagues ...
I'm a Scot but I've never heard of this before ! Is there any particular reason ?
He's a professional , he knows what to do ! s
I think that's a good thing , I'm not sure why people are downvoting you for saying something like that ! :D Thanks !
Thanks for your support ! We're all in it together .
I do . I'm a big gamer and have been playing GTA V for the past few days now ! :D
Croatia is my favorite team to support ! I hope you win it all and get a good draw for your first match against us :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but that's the best description of cancer I've ever heard !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take it as sarcasm because that is exactly what happened to me when my grandmother died ...
I'm the same age as you and it's my first birthday too ... Happy Birthday to us both then haha x3
I can't see your comments on the sub but they are visible to me ...
I would just use a USB stick . I don't think you can transfer files from an internal HDD to an External HDD . You'd have to do it through your PC . Sorry ! :P Good luck with that though ...
I think the point is to make sure you get paid .
That was a great movie , I wish they would make more of them !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I'll take it as sarcasm anyway ! :D Thanks for the laugh though haha xd lt 3333
Good luck ! I hope you get it sorted out soon :D
RemindMe ! 2 days Donation for r millionairemakers
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll . Either way I laughed at your comment and upvoted the post because of this . Have fun with your new found karma friendo lt 3
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that you're right about this ... but it's probably both , so good luck ! :D Go Sparty ?
I think it's more that they're playing against teams from other regions , and are getting stomped by EU teams at worlds level of play ... which makes them look weak to me ! :P sry for bad joke lolz xD lt 3
I'm pretty sure it's the latter . I've been up for a few hours now and have had no problems with my stomach , but that might just mean nothing to me ... ? :P Thanks ! lt 3
I'm pretty sure that's not true , but I could be wrong about this one ...
I was waiting for it to happen . I'm glad someone else noticed that too haha :D Thanks !
I think that was a mistake , but I'm not sure what they did with it in this version of the game ...
I think you mean bowel movement , but yeah that's what it sounds like to me too ! :D Edit : spelling ...
Same here . Got the same thing as well , but it was from an event and not in my pokedex :P
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I think it's funny either way ! :D
Peeta is a better actor . I think he's the best choice for that role , but it was probably just because of his age and experience in acting before being cast as Kunta . :P ! ?
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ... I think it is both ! :D
I love that song ! I'm a big fan of The Beatles and Queen's music so this is one for me too :D Thanks ! lt 3
I'm not sure , but it's a good question . Maybe you're just trying to be funny and make people laugh at your expense ... or something like that ! :P
I'm sure you're joking but that's actually the official nickname of one of our players on this sub ...
I think it's more like she was trying to get a reaction out of the employee . I don't know why they would throw them though ..
I've heard good things about the one on the corner of the river from the airport that has some great pizza !
I'm surprised you're not paying 5 a gallon . I pay 4.50 for regular and 6.00 per liter of premium .
I think it's just that the parties are so different , and they're not really comparable .
I agree , but it's not a bad idea to have some sort of PvE mode for those who don't play PvP .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I've never heard it called soon before , but now I know what the term means and will use this from here on out ! :D Thanks for sharing OP's name ...
I'm sorry to hear that . I hope you can find a new place soon ! lt 3 hugs
I like this one , it's a little more formal than my other ones though ! Thanks for sharing your opinion on that one too :D
I'm Canadian and I play Hockey , but not in Canada ...
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've been using LibGen since the beginning of time ... It's great to have a library that is open source as well though .. Thanks anyway man lt 3333
I've never had either of those places ... but now you mention it , I'll have to check them out ! Thanks for your help ! :D
I think the title of this post should be , I'm not sure if my wife would like to see me do something with myself ... or maybe even worse : ' My Wife's Not Sure ! ?
He's been awful for a while now tbh ... He has no confidence and is always in trouble when it matters most ..
I think he's gonna get some sort of hair transplant or something like that and shave it for the role . I'm sure there are plenty of people who could do it ! :D Edit spelling ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but I think it was sarcasm ... ?
Or just give him an axe and let his sword be a melee weapon , like in FE : Awakening !
I'm from MI and I've never seen one . It's not that far away , but it is pretty much unheard of for me to see them anywhere else than Lansing or Ann Arbor ... ? ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolololllllz
He was arrested at the airport , so that would be unlikely ... but if you're going by what happened with him then yes probably not likely either way ! :D Edit spelling error .. lolololoolllll
I agree , but I think it's more that people are just not willing or able enough for something like this in their own game . It doesn't work well at all ... lol ! :P Sorry guys .. haha XD lt 3
I'm not sure if I can do it but thanks !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll ... but that's the way it is in my country too !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but it's actually Matt Damon from The Martian !
I'm glad you're safe ! We are all in good hands now :D
I think that was a reference to his father , not himself ... but I could be wrong on this one ! :D
I think he was talking specifically of how much weight they put on him and not just their overall size . I could be wrong though ...
Patrick Wilson was a great actor , I think he's underrated in this role because of his look alone though ...
i'll add you to the list ! thanks for being awesome lt 3 u bb
I'm sure you'll find a way . I've been making it since the beginning of time , but that's just because my wife is so good at cooking ! :D
Because we're not playing the best team in football . That's why ! s
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but I think it's funny that he was so popular with his supporters before becoming President ...
It's a toyota . It has to be road legal for it not being street legal is the point of this sub ...
I don't know , it's a pretty good idea for me ! :D It would make my life so much easier though ...
I'm thinking it's gonna be an evil villain . I don't know why , but this makes sense for some reason ...
I'm not even mad . That's amazing !
I think it was a joke , but I'm not sure ...
I'm glad too , but I was just thinking that it's a bit odd to have someone be so careless with an animal like this ... especially when they're not even hurt ? :P Thanks for commenting anyway lt 3
I'm still watching the original series , but it's been too long since I've seen this one ! It really is an amazing anime to rewatch after finishing the movies :D Thanks again ! lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but I don't see how that's possible ?
I think he's a little overweight , but that doesn't mean his body is bad for being so thin and lean ! He just has to work on it ... lol :P hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
It's not golden , it is just very white . It looks like an old dog with black hair and brown eyes to me !
You're welcome ! It's a great place for the price and it has some good stuff in there too :D
It is a little overpriced , but I think they have some of their best chicken wings around here !
Fins up !
I'm in the same boat . I think it's a good move to bring him back after his injury last season and give him some experience with our team again !
I'd do that in a heartbeat . I think we could get some good value out of both players if they were on the same team together though ...
I think she's fine , but I don't want to see her fight anyone else for that spot either ...
I've been using Sync for a while now ... It's pretty nice ! But yeah , Bacon Reader has some really great features too :D
I'm glad you enjoyed it ! :D Thank you for your support , and happy cake day ! lt 3
I thought it looked like the guy from that movie where he's trying to get his hand out of the freezer and gets stuck in there for some reason ? !
What's your favorite color ? Mine is blue but it s not a very good one ...
I think it was a combination of that and being in shape for MMA . He has always been very explosive but I don't know if this will be an improvement from last year ... ? ! lolololoolllll .. :D D: lt 3
You're a good person and I like you ! Have an upvote !
I'm not sure if I should be thankful or sad for this idea ...
Because the truck is in London .
I'm from Maryland too ! :D
I think he's going to have an amazing season , but I don't see him being as good of a WR2 or 3 than Gronk is right now ...
He's a troll . Ignore him , and move on with your life ! s
Happy Cake Day to u too . :D
I'm pretty sure it's a reference from the movie , but that doesn t mean you can just go and make up your own title for no reason ! :P
I'm not sure what you're talking about but he's definitely better than LeBron at least for his career so far ...
I thought he had some sorta weird obsession with his own hair . I'm glad someone else noticed that too !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll ... but it's definitely the same thing as that one ! :D
I think it's more that they were down by 20 at one point . They had to play with their best player out for most of game 4 or 5 though ... ? lol ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed hahaahahaahahhhaa .. haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
I think you mean'color blind ' ... but yes ! It's still pretty cool to read these things on paper or something like that haha :D
That's a paddlin ' !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . Either way , it's hilarious and sad at the same time ...
That's a good way to put it . I'm sure he would have been happy if his son had just walked out of there with no injuries or anything like that ...
I'm pretty sure that was just for funsies though ? I mean it wasn t like his actual name or anything but still .. lol ! He s definitely evil tho edit 2 3 4 uuuu 2h4g3r5m8e7y1l0t
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but it's a quote from that movie with the guy who plays him in the show !
I'm doing well , thanks . I've been working on a project for my class so it's nice to be able get some time off from work :D how about yourself ?
I'm not familiar with that reference , but it's a great movie !
Because it's a title .
I think they're just getting used to playing against a good offense and not being able to adjust for that kind of stuff yet ...
I'm in California , but not from there ! But thanks for reminding me to do this anyway ...
I think that's a good point ! I'm not sure why people are so against it though ... It seems like such an easy thing to do and make sense .. ? :P lolololllllzhahahahaha XD xD lt 3333
You're not going anywhere with this team ... you'll be fine !
I was there for that match ... it's not like they were playing well or anything either way though so no big deal really !
I'd watch that !
I would if I could get away with it , but no one can afford that kind of stuff anymore ... so yeah probably not lol ! :P But yes definitely stealing something like this haha .. hahaha XD xD lt 3
Dr.No u , I'm not a doctor !
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is happening ... but it's definitely something to celebrate !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but that's exactly what it is ...
I think he was just being traded because they were trying out some new players and wanted him on their team before moving up in the draft ... ? I dunno though lol .. ! sry :P Edit : spelling error fixed it's not funny anymore hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
3.Being the best player in his own team's history and being able to play with any other players he wants without getting suspended for drug use or whatever ... wait , what ? ! s
I think it's more that the dinosaurs are gone . The only thing they can do now to survive in a different environment would be eat other animals or something like that ...
I think he was just trying not get his head cut off by a shark or something , but I'm sure the sharks would've been more than happy with him getting away ...
Or maybe they will use a different actor for each one ? I don't know , but it's possible ! :D
I don't think he's going to have any kids , but I'm sure his wife will get some of them in the future !
I'm pretty sure that's a picture of the actual letter , not just an image of the signature on the backside .
I'm sure you're a great person and all but I don't think that's what happened here ...
I'm not sure what you're getting at , but I'll take it anyway !
We have one , he's just not good enough to be the starter in our division anymore ...
We have a lot of corn . And beer ! Lots and lots more than you guys do , though I'm sure it doesn't help much in the long run either way :P Edit spelling error fixed now lolololllllzzzzt
I'm not sure , but I think it's because he has to eat the bagel .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I hope it's sarcasm , but that would be a pretty bad joke ...
I've had that happen once or twice in my life ... I was so mad at them for it and they just laughed about me not knowing what happened lol ..
They were probably just trying to sneak into a different building , and then got caught by security because of their size ... or something like that .. I dunno lol ! :P
I'm sorry , but you're not allowed to use your own name in this subreddit ! You have been banned from r pyongyang and r PyongyangCirclejerk as well :P s
I think you mean legalize and tax , not legalize ... but I'm sure that's what they meant anyway ! s
The Emperor's Children ?
I think it's the fact his team has a winning record against him this year and not just one of those games where they lose by 20 points or more ... ? ! I dunno .. lolololloloooloo
He is also one of those champions that can be played in any role , so you don't have much choice but support or jungle if your team needs it ...
That's not what happened , but it was funny to me anyway ! :D I'm sure you're right though ...
Thanks for the support ! We're working on a few more projects atm but we'll keep you posted if anything comes up in our development process :D Thanks again ! lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious but that's awesome ! Thanks for sharing your knowledge and info about these things in general though it was really cool of u to share this with us all ... lol lt 3
I think that was just an homage to Star Wars , not necessarily a reference to the original film .
That is a lot of people ! I'm sure they're all very happy to have you as their neighbor , though ...
I'm a Cards fan , but not really into baseball ... so that's probably why they're here ! :P But yeah it seems to be mostly Cubbies and Reds fans over there too lolololllz .. hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
You're fine , it's just that you seem like a really cool guy .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take your word for it ! :D
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think that was the joke ...
I think it's more about how much they paid him than what happened to his career after that trade , but I could be wrong on that one ...
He got a concussion . He's fine now though !
I think it's a good idea , but I don't know if they'll be able to get the rights for that .
I think that's what he did , but I'm not sure ...
I'm already there lololollolo
I'm sorry for your loss of money , but at least you got a good game ! :D
I think they're trying to compete by having a lot of different shows on Netflix but it's not working out so well ...
I think it's more like , how do you survive a crash ? You don't ! That is why I am not going back there ...
I have an old friend who has two cats named Steve and Jeff ... I think they're both girls though !
It's not really an issue of whether or not the president is guilty , but rather if he was impeached before being sworn in as President by Congress ... which happened last year .. lol ! :P Edit spelling error fixed that one up hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
I'm going to be so excited ! I've been waiting since last year's premiere . It'll be my first time seeing it live , and will probably have a blast with all of this hype :D D: lt 3333333333 33
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
I'm still waiting on the second one . It's been so long since they've done anything with it that I don t even remember what happened in the last one ... lolololooolooollllloooooowwwwwwoooohhhhhhahahahahaaaaahhhhaaaaaaaaawwweeeeellooooooooooooooooooooooooaalrightyeeeeehhhhhehee hehehehe haHAAHA HAHA HAAA hAHHH
Yeah , I'm not sure why they did that . It's just weird to have the same colors for every team in the league and then change them up later on ?
I'm not sure what this means , but I like it ! :D
It is . But the people who are going to be accused of this will not have any evidence that they were involved in anything illegal or unethical at all ... so there you go ! s
I think it should be named after the guy who invented the term “ erneh ” in the first place ...
It's a pretty steep hill , so I'm guessing she didn't even get to that point .
You're on ! I'll sign it too if you want to do that ...
I'm not sure what your definition of'working hours are but I've worked for a few companies where this is an option as well !
I'm not sure if this is a joke or not , but I like it .
It's not like they're going to sue us for something that isn t even a law in their country ... oh wait ..
I'm with you on that one !
I think you're right ! I was thinking it looked more like a bird than a plane ... but that makes sense too haha :D Thanks for your help though man lt 3
The Morky McMaulface ?
I'm sure she's not into you . I'd be more than happy if her boyfriend was interested in me though ! :D
Yes it did ! It was in an episode where they were trying out for the royal wedding but she got pregnant with twins so ... yeahhhhhh :P Edit spelling
I'm sure there are a lot more then just those two users though ... I mean you can't really say everyone uses UPlay but yeah ..
I'm not sure , but if you're looking at white castle as an adult then yes they are very tasty !
I think you're onto something . I'm going back in time now ...
I'm going with a roll . I think it's time for me and my friends to move forward , but there is no definite answer yet !
Alexis has been playing well , but he's not a starter for Arsenal anymore ...
I'm sure it's possible with some sort of laser engraving tool or similar ... but yeah , the lighter batteries are more likely than not going to be enough for this application :P haha ..
I think he was just trying to get a good look at her . He's not going for an arm bar , but rather something more subtle than grabbing it by its sleeve ... ? shrugs .. maybe lolololoolllll
It's a blanket , it was made for him to sleep in and he just put on some clothes so I'm not sure where exactly but there are holes all over ! :D
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think that's a pretty good point to make in this case ...
I'm pretty sure that's a Jewish thing , not an American one ...
It's an American thing but it is pretty common here too !
Sure thing . Thanks for the offer though :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but that's the spirit !
I've got one of these and love mine , great gun !
Used it , thanks ! :D
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but the hatred is real here and there ... just like any other game thread on this sub !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but I think it's funny that the only thing we have to worry about is our own health care system ! s ... wait .. what ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , so here's an upvote for your effort ! :D
I'm at about 90 right now ...
I'm not sure if this is sarcasm or not ... but I think it's a good idea for some people and an awful one for others ?
I'm guessing he's a dog owner , and not just an animal lover who likes to walk his pets around barefoot ... I mean it would be weird if they didn't ! :P Edit spelling error ..
I'm pretty sure it was a joke about the fact she can't shoot through walls and such like in Overwatch but I could be wrong though :P Edit : spelling
I'm pretty sure that's what they did with the first game and I think there was an option for both weapons in this version as well ... ? Maybe not though .. :P Edit spelling ! D: lt 3
I think so ... I've never been there but it seems like that would be what most people say when talking about Applebees .
I think that's a woman ? She looks like one of those girls from The Office who are always in trouble with their husbands and boyfriends ...
I'm sure they have a list somewhere , but I doubt it's that long and not all are bad people ...
I'm sure you're not going anywhere . You've got a lot of fans that will still watch regardless if it's Cleveland or Miami next year !
I think he's going for the record , not necessarily his stats . I'm sure there are plenty of other players who could get in on this list too though ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is the top comment on a post about an anime character who's name was actually spelled wrong ...
Yeah , I'm thinking of doing that too ! Thanks for reminding me about this thread though :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making a joke ... but I think it's actually spelled Barba Lazerre ?
It's like the refs are trying their best not too . They're just being extra careful with calls and making sure they don't get called for anything . It makes sense , really ! :D D: lt 3
I was thinking that too , but I think they were just trying not get hit by a car or something and didn't want them getting hurt in any way shape form this video ... ? ! :P Edit : grammar
I'm sure you could find a way to do this with your mouth , too !
I think he's a good champ , but I don't like him as much than most of the other champions in this game and that is saying something ... lol ! :D D: XD xdxdxddeepsssdfghjklmnnngggggehjsdkdjkdsdhfkjglbgsgdksfdkklsfscklnsbsllndt ?
I'm glad you enjoyed it ! It was a lot of fun to make .
I enjoy them too . But it's not like they're playing against a team that is going to be able to score on us , so ... yeah !
I've never had a problem with it but that's just me ! It doesn t seem to be an issue for everyone though so maybe you re right lolol :P Thanks anyway tho lt 3333
I think it's pretty clear he meant to say I'm sorry for what you've done and not the other way around ... which is why his comment got deleted ? :P Edit : grammar ! spelling
A place where trucks are sold and not just for the sake of selling them ... I think that's what he meant to say though ..
I'm not saying it's a bad thing , I just think the idea of having to play through an entire story in one sitting is pretty lame . It would be boring imo ... lol ! :P hahaahahaahahhhaa .. haaaaahhhheeeehee heeeeeehhhhhhhh
I've seen the first two episodes of that movie about 10 years ago ... It was awful to me then but now its hilarious !
I was going to say that too . The 90s were amazing for movies and music !
See what he said ! If not too many people cared then there wouldn t be a movie about him ...
I'm not even mad anymore ...
I'm sure it was a lot of work , but I bet they had some fun with it !
I think you're a good man and should be proud of yourself !
Our oline has been pretty solid for a while now , but our d lineman are just getting better and better each week !
I think it's more likely to be a new character than anything else but I could see them doing something like that in the future if there is interest for it ! :D Thanks though man lt 3333cough cough .. lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwwwweweelloooooooooohhhahahahaahhhaaaaahhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeyyyyuhuuuughghgghggG
I'm sorry for your loss .
I'm not sure if you are being sarcastic or serious , but I think it is a good thing that we have this subreddit for such things to exist ! :D DDDd ... wait .. what ?
I'm not a fan of them either but they're still my favorite team so it's cool that you guys are rooting against us ! :D lt 3
The Bongos .
It is . It was revealed at E3 last year , and they showed off some gameplay footage from it during their presentation .
I'd love a job in the oil industry . I'm not sure if that's what OP wants , but it sounds interesting !
And if they don't do this by Christmas time we can just send them a letter saying'you're not welcome here anymore ! '
It is very fun and has some great atmosphere in its world building . It also feels like an open world survival horror type of thing so there are lots more options for exploration too :D Edit spelling ...
Link please ? ! Thanks in advance . :D
I'm not sure why , but it's just something that came to me and was interesting enough for this thread ...
I did ! It was a lot of fun and very challenging at times but still not as difficult than playing on an emulator .
I'm good thanks ! I was just thinking about the vampire thing though ...
I'm gonna go with this guy's username for president ! u jimmyjones 2016
I'm glad you enjoyed it ! Thanks a lot , man :D
Because he's the only one who can be a face .
The only one I can think of is the scene where he's in a room with his wife and daughter , but it was just an example to illustrate how bad they are ...
I've never heard of him , but I'm sure he's a great guy !
I have a few of those , but they're not very good quality and I don't want to use them for anything more than recording my phone's voice commands or whatever ... :P Thanks though ! lt 3
He pitted at the same place as Vettel and got faster than him by 1 second or so I think ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think that's a pretty good analogy for this situation ...
I think he was trying not to look like a child molester ...
It's a blast . I'm so excited for the next season of this show and hopefully we'll have more episodes in the future as well :D
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . But it's funny either way , so upvote for ya :D Edit : spelling is hard sometimes xd Thanks guys lt 3
You're doing more than I am .
I'm in the UK and it was about 20C today , but we're still getting warmer than usual !
I'll take you up on that offer , but only if we're both wearing the same shirt and have a beard !
I'm not sure , maybe . But if you're interested in the topic then why don't we just post a link here and see how many comments there are on that thread ! :D
I think it was both .
I think they'll be fine , but if you're going to do something like that ... don't forget your towel !
I think that's a good one , but I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling ...
Thanks ! It's a great place , and the view is amazing from there too :D
It's a joke from an episode of South Park where they were trying out for their own show and got hired by Disney . It was pretty funny though ! :D Edit spelling error ...
I'm sure you're right , but it doesn't mean he isn t doing something about it though ! s
Because he's fun , that's all I can think of when people say Urgots kit isn't good or bad ...
He's going for the long walk , I think it was his way of saying goodbye and that we're all here now so let me get outta there real quick !
I'm sure they're just trying their best not too , but I think it's more that they don't want you guys getting any ideas about them or anything like this ... ? ! :P Edit : grammar
Yeah I was just thinking about that one ... it's a good trick though !
I think it was a tie ?
He is a black man , so it makes sense that his name would sound white ...
That was a great one ! I'm glad you enjoyed it :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun but that's exactly what happened when i switched from an iPhone 5s to a Sony Xperia Z5 Compact ...
I'm not a big hockey guy , but I can see how it could be seen as disrespectful to some fans and others as well ...
I think it's only if you're a minor . I'm not sure though ...
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think it's pretty clear that Canada is going for independence and will be staying with its current government until they change their mind ...
It's not ignoring the fact that they're allies with each other though ...
I think you're right about that one ... I'm not sure what's going on with your team though ! Maybe they just need to get their act together ? :P
You know me so well , u TheRealDankestOfUsername ! :P
He was also on The Leftovers , which has been pretty good so far and his character seems like an interesting one too !
I'm sure they would if it was convenient for them ... but I doubt that's what Putin wants right now either ..
I'm sure you're right but I don't think that was a criticism of Michelle Obama or anything like what Trump has been doing in regards to his cabinet appointments ... ?
It's not like he has a choice in that regard , though ... He can't vote until his 30s and still have to serve as President of America ! s
I've never seen anyone use the term over there but I'm sure they're used in some places ! Thanks for your input and good luck with whatever you decide to do haha :D lt 3
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that it's true ... but at least he didn t get his head blown off by an exploding mech suit ! :D D: lt 3
That's what I expected too , but it wasn't until after he finished pouring and then started cleaning that my first reaction was ... oh god no ! ?
I'm so glad I didn't watch the whole thing , that was hilarious !
I've seen a few on here and I'm not sure if they're real or just made to look like it is ... but yeah ..
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but I think he's dead now and the tumor has metastasized into his brain .
Done.back to me , thx
He's an actual human . He just has no powers or abilities , and is basically a normal sized mannequin .
I think he is trying to get karma by posting multiple pictures of his own dog in one post , and then linking them all together for karma ... ? I dunno .. shrugs maybe ! :P
I'm not sure what that means , but I'll take the compliment .
I'm sorry , I didn't know that was a rule ! Thank you though :D
He's been getting fouled a lot . He has 2 assists though , but he was only on for like 5 minutes total in that game and got 0 points or assist lol ..
It's a guy in his 40s , I think he was just standing there with an empty beer bottle and some other stuff on him ...
I'm in the Twin Cities and I've never heard a crowd that was louder than this . It's pretty quiet out there , but it is still very loud !
I'm waiting on a sequel to that one too !
I'm a time traveler !
I feel you bro ... i felt like a kid again after losing to that guy on my team last night lol ..
I'm on the west side of town . I don't know where to even start with this one ...
It will be a lot more expensive than that . The city is already paying for it with taxes and fees .
It's on Netflix , if you have that ! It is a great movie and has some of my favorite scenes from the show as well ...
Fnatic is a good team , they just have to play better than the other teams . They are not that bad though ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I hope it's sarcasm because that sounds about right for this team ...
I think that's a bit more than just Berlin , but yeah it does seem like there should be some exceptions to this rule as well ...
I'm sure he has a lot of other tricks up there too .
I'd love that , I'll PM u the link when i get home from work tonight or tomorrow morning :D Thanks for sharing this though man lt 3
I think it's a genetic thing ... or maybe just genetics in general are weird like that sometimes ! :D
He's a good actor , but I don't know if that was intentional or not ...
And then he'll be cast as the lead role of The Last Airbender on Nickelodeon !
I'm not sure what you mean by that ... I think it's pretty clear he means a war between two countries with very different goals and objectives than each other ?
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll . Either way I laughed at your comment and upvoted it ! Have an updoot ! :D DDDdooOoOOoooooooOMmmmmmMmmmmMMm ...
I think it's more that people are starting to realize how much money they're getting from him . He has a lot of fans and sponsors now , so there will be publicity ! :D DD ... wait .. nvm ? lolololoolllllooooloooowwwwwwooooooshhhahahahaahhhaaaaahhhhhhhhheeeeeeheeohhhhhhuhuuhuuughaaaaaawwwhaaaatttt
I'm paying 1100 for an apartment with two bedrooms and one bathroom ...
I'm thinking the same thing , but I don't know if that's a good idea for her or not ...
I think he's a great actor and I'm glad they went with him for the role ! He was also in The Big Lebowski so that makes sense too haha :P Edit spelling error ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling ... but I'll take it as sarcasm anyway ! Thanks for the advice though :D
I'm not sure if it is , but I've heard that they can be very damaging to your health and are a lot more expensive than other sports like hockey or football ... ? ! s Edit : spelling error fixed .. lol jk edit 2.0 x10 0 1
I'm fine . I don't want to play them again , but if they're going down that road then we'll take it and make sure the game is fun for everyone ! :D lt 3
He's dead .
I'm from Portland and I've never heard of this place ! Where is that at if you don t mind me asking ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , so ... :P
I think you mean 3rd worst team lol ... but yeah I agree with your point about coaches being a huge part for them to win it all ! :D edit spelling error haha .. sorry guys D: lt 333333 3333 333 3333333 2 0.0
I'm sorry . It's been a while since i've seen it and I don t remember anything about that scene ... but you should watch it anyway if you're interested in seeing more of it :P haha ..
That's a good idea , I'll look into that ! Thanks man :D
I think he was trying too hard . He didn't even try his best , but I'm sure it's a good thing for him and everyone else involved ! s
I was thinking he looked more like a young Bill Murray , but I guess you're right too :D Thanks for watching and commenting on it ! It's really cool to see these guys interact with each other ... lol XD lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but I laughed pretty hard at this one ...
I'm sure they'll be fine , but it's still pretty bad for them and their economy if we don't get anything done about it in time ...
I'm in the same boat . I've been trying to get one but no luck so far ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad for them . They're still my number 2 team , but they've been pretty bad this year so far ...
His dad . Hannibal was a cannibal and he ate him to get rid of all that meat in season 2 , so it's not like they were just going for revenge ... right guys .. ssss ! Right people :D D:
I got nothing either , but it's still annoying lol !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... I'll take the latter for 100 ! :D Thanks though and good luck with your sale ! lt 3
I think it's a good idea . I'm not sure why they're doing this though ...
I think the reason is that there are no more people willing and able than before , so they're not going anywhere unless someone else wants them back in a different way ... or something .. lol ! :P
He's still pretty ripped though !
I think he was trying to get the refs on his side by saying that it wasn't a penalty and they should have called one instead of two penalties for him ? lol ...
I've been there . It's pretty good , but I prefer Pho King .
You re welcome ! Good luck on your journey man :D
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I just wanted to share my experience with the community , and it's a good way for people who don't know about this stuff ! :D Thanks though lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling . But it's a joke about how they all died in one hit and then respawned after that ...
I think she's gonna be a little more than just Dolores , but I'm not sure about that yet ...
I'm not sure , but I hope so !
I'm sure it's a lot of people who don't know about the stuff and just want some cheap beer that they can drink at home without paying an arm amp leg price ! s
I think you mean'there's absolutely zero chance that we do not make it through this tournament , but I'm sure they'll be happy enough if we win ! '
Yeah , that's what we're doing for the next two years at least !
Spurs is the team that won't win a title .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say here ... Vietnam was an extremely well organized and disciplined guerrilla campaign with no major casualties or losses by either side ?
I'm a fan .
That would be a good idea , but I don't know if it's possible to do that . Maybe in the future ? :P But yeah ... maybe not right now ! xD Thanks though lt 3
I think so . I don't know how much it would help , but if you can get him to do that then yes !
It's a parody of the manga , so it makes sense that they're trying to make their characters look like anime protagonists instead if being real people in this world ... ? :P
It is indeed ! I was wondering if it would be too much of an impact to see in game but that makes sense now :D Thanks for pointing this out though lt 3
And he had a beard !
You are correct ! It's in Burnaby , BC on Saturday night .
The league is the same , but you have to be in one of those teams for at least 10 years before they become relevant again ... so yeah ..
I can't even fathom that , but it's still pretty funny !
It's a good thing I'm not in charge of that . :P But yeah , the sound would be pretty bad ...
I'm pretty sure he was at least 3x bigger than average , and probably more muscular as well ... so yeah not very scary for me either lol ! But thanks anyway haha ..
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad , but it is definitely something ! :D
I liked both seasons . It's a bit more serious , but still fun and entertaining !
I'm not sure if that's the best way to go about it ... But yeah , definitely worth getting some of those cheap ones !
It's not like they're going anywhere ... right ? Right guys ! Guys .. ?
I've been thinking of getting into eve for a while now ... but the only thing that keeps me from doing so is my lack o skill level :P
I hope it works ! Good luck to you and your pup :D lt 3
I'm from Idaho and we have no winter here lol but yeah that's what you said haha :D
As an American who has lived in both countries for years ... you're not my friend . You have no idea what it's like to be hated by people from other places ..
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think that's a pretty good idea actually ...
You're a mod now , you can't ban me !
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've read the book and it's pretty good ! It has some of my favorite lines from the movie too :D
I love the smell of my own vomit ! I'm not a fan though ...
That was me when I saw it on the front page yesterday , lol !
I'm sorry , I don't understand what you're trying to say ...
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad . I'll take either one ! :D
I think they took 2 games , but I'm pretty sure it was a sweep by GS if you count Game 1 of the WCF against OKC as well ... ? Edit : typo error !
I think they'll meet at the Tokyo Dome , but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go there for this match ...
I'm pretty sure he's listed as like 7 foot tall on the team website and 247sports.com so I think it'll be fine if they're not too big or anything ... ? ! s Edit : spelling error fixed that one lolz .. sorry guys hahaahahaahahhhaaayyyyeeehhhhhhheeeeeehhhh
I don't think he's going anywhere , but if you're not gonna be there when it happens ... well then ... bye !
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is a thing .
He's a good player . He'll be fine !
I think it's a good idea to have both . I'm not sure if they'll be able to keep up with each other though ... but that would make sense ! :D DDDddd daaaaaaaddddddduuuudeee
I think you mean , because of all those people who died in the war ? I don't know how they managed to get out alive ...
I'm sure he would've made it if they didn't call holding on him for like 5 yards ...
You're a good person , u dumdumsquidle ! You should be proud to have such an awesome username and flair combo ... I'm sure your parents are happy with it too .. lolololllz lt 3333
You're not alone , I've been there too !
I'm not sure , but I think it's a good idea to have the option of having both streams on one channel and then switching between them at different times ...
I think that was the last one of season 2 ? It's not like there were any other episodes after that or anything .. right guys ! Right people ssssstttt :D DDDdddeee daaaaaaadoooooommmmmmmmmmm muuuuhhhhhhh mmmeeeeeh mehhhmooomooooonnnnnggggghhtfffffffffyyyooooooooowwwwwwppp edit
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... But it's an Impala .
I've never tried it , but I'm sure you could make one with some sugar and water ! It's not bad at all though ...
I have an amd card and this happens with all of them ... It's not that uncommon for people who are on windows 10 or older drivers though ..
I did . It was pretty awesome !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I hope it's sarcasm , because that would be hilarious ! :D
Tatar is the name for people who live in Crimea . It means'landless'as well !
I think you mean'it is time for the Earthlings . '
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I think the idea is more like a government agency taking over the power and control from private corporations in order for them profit ...
He was the one who got hit in that play too ...
I think you mean drain the dumplings !
You can't even see the gun ! It's a trap ...
I'm sure there are plenty of reasons not too , but that doesn't mean they're wrong or anything ... right ? Right guys ! Guys .. ? s
I think the EU should do more than just a few countries and not even mention it on their official websites or anything ...
I think it's more like 1.5 bn or so per person and the rest are probably dead by now from drinking too much booze ...
I'm not sure if I should be offended or happy that you're making me laugh out loud at work ...
He's talking about his teammates . He was referring to himself in that context as well though ...
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this is my first thought when reading your comment ...
I think he's the only one who can say that , but I'm not sure if it counts as his final play because of how long he played for us ... ? !
They would have been awarded the ball back .
I'm with you on that one , but we're not going anywhere anytime soon so ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but that was a good one !
I'm not sure , but I think the bike got stuck in mud .
I'm sure they'll be fine with a few million dead and some extra money to pay for their families ... oh wait ..
There are dozens of us ! Dozens , even ...
Yes , but it's not like they're going to win the game . They'll probably lose 3 0 or something and then get knocked out of WCQ by Spain in the group stage anyway ...
He's also been nominated for best actor twice and has won two Oscars ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but it's pretty much guaranteed that both teams will win this tournament and make finals in 2018 WCG .
I do this all day long at work and it's always a good idea !
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this happened .
I think I saw him do this in practice too ! He's got some serious hops and is very athletic for his size lolololoolllll ...
He was on the radio for like 10 minutes last night , I think it might be time we got rid of that guy ...
I think it's actually Sir Alec Guinness .
I'm sure he's got some sorta super power that can't be resisted , but I don t think it s the same as being able control his body temperature and stuff like that ... ? :P Edit : spelling ! D: lt 3
You're not alone , but you are definitely in this group of people who have never been told they were wrong about something before and will be forever haunted by it ! :D lt 3 u bbzkitties
He was just trying to get the last word in before they both left for their respective teams ...
I'm sure there are some people who would eat you if it was possible ...
I agree , I think they should have gone for gold instead !
No , they're still in . They have to win their division and lose one more game for it not be possible but if we beat them then yes I think so ! edit spelling error ... sorry guys .. lolololllllzzzzzzzzsss
She's supposed too have the same stats as her old self but is now much stronger in lane because it has no mana costs anymore ! :D
It's a good sign ! I'm sure he'll be happy to see that his work is finally done and can move on from this project ... right ? Right guys .. Guys , what do we say now ?
I'm not sure I understand the reference . Can you explain ? Edit : Nevermind , found out what he meant and got a little excited for some reason ...
He's not buying anything though ? I thought he was just renting it out for the time being until his wife got back to him in London or something like that .. sry :P !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but it's a good thing that we have the best team in baseball right now !
I'm sure they're just using some sorta chemical to remove them , but I don't think there are any real methods for cleaning rocks like this one . It would be pretty expensive though ! :P Edit spelling error fixed .. lolololoollllloooooowwwwww lt 3
I mean , it's a pretty good way of telling if someone has been playing Kled wrong .
I think you mean second worst , but yeah I agree they're not a great side either way !
I think it's been pretty good . I'm enjoying this match a lot more than last week and that was my first one as well !
I feel like this is a good way to describe my feelings about life , too ! I'm glad you're here for us all though lt 3 hugs and love from another stranger :D D: hugsss
I think you mean bestest heros !
I think you mean a paradox of sorts ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take your word on that one ! Haha thanks though man ...
I'm sure he's still in the hospital from that one hit to his head ...
I think you mean Bollywood .
Gus is not even close to being top 5 at HW imo ... He's probably 3rd or 4th best if you're talking about pure strength alone though ..
I think he's just trying to get a reaction out of the crowd , but they're not really getting one from him so far ...
He also didn t have the infinity stones to beat her , so it s not like she was a one shot wonder or anything ...
I'm sure he would have been fine if his lungs were filled with helium .
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
I'm in !
I'm hoping for a good game of football !
I agree ! I think it's really neat and useful for the future in general as well ...
I think it's a lot more than just one . It was probably at least 3 4 of them in total ... and they were all pretty good throws too lolololloloooloo
I'm sure they do , but I've never seen one that did ...
What's your favorite color , btw ! Mine is blue but yours might be purple or green depending how much time it takes for you to get back from school ... :P
I'm not sure what you're trying to say . I think it's pretty clear that the umps were saying he didn't have control of his bat at all , but whatever works for ya ! :P Edit : words
It's a good show . It has some of my favorite moments from last season in there too !
I'm sure they'll get it right eventually ... I mean the guy who made this is probably just an intern for Apple or something .. s
I'll take you up on that offer . I'm going there tomorrow morning from the UK so it's not too far away :D
I'd pay to see that movie !
I'm not sure if I should be worried or excited about that possibility ! :D But thanks for your concern , it's a good thing we're all here together in this community lt 3333
I'm sorry for your loss . I hope you can find someone who will love her and care about what they have left of their lives ! lt 3 hugs
She was pretty good in S1 though ...
I was born there !
I'm pretty sure that was the joke ...
I'm not sure what you're asking . I don't think there's any way to know that , but it would be nice if someone could clarify for us ! :D Edit : spelling error fixed ...
I'm sure the pain is mutual . He's a good kid , but I don't think his dad would have let him play in that situation either way !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it's actually an actual flower that grows on the moon and is used to make flowers for astronauts ...
That was a good one ! I'm going through my dads list of things that are not related and it is all from him saying this lololollolooolooowwwwww ...
The Gulf Coast .
I'm in the same boat as you guys ... but with no sleep :P
That's a good idea too ! I'm not sure how that would work though ...
I think she's actually really good looking . She looks like an attractive woman who is just trying too hard and not getting enough attention from the public , but it works for her ...
I'm glad you enjoyed it ! I've been wanting to watch this for a while now , but haven't gotten around watching the first season yet ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic . I hope it's sarcasm because that sounds like something they would do for their employees'sake ! :P Edit spelling
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think that's actually an actual quote from Birdman ...
He's a big fan . I heard he has his own private jet and everything !
I loved the first round of Neto v . Meruem , but I think it's a close second for me is the last one where he got knocked out by a kick to his face ! :D
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious . Either way it's a great game to watch and will probably have some good memories for both teams involved ...
Not very . The US is a lot more powerful than the Russians and they have nukes that can destroy Europe in one hit if it's not careful enough ...
I'm not sure I understand what you're saying ... can someone explain please ! :D Thanks for sharing this info with me though ..
I'm sure you'll get a good pop for it !
I think he was just trying to get his team some rest .
I'm sorry , I didn t know there was one for this show and it s not my video so i thought maybe someone else would enjoy hearing about it here too ? Thanks though :D Sorry again ...
I'm not sure , but I think it's the same one that had an Eagles fan on their team .
I think you're onto something . I'm going to go with this theory now , thanks ! :D Edit : spelling ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it's funny either way ! :D
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad . I think it sounds like he was saying something along the lines of'see ya soon new guy ? ' ...
I'd watch that .
I'm in the same boat , but I have a job and can't afford to live on my own ... so it's not that bad ! :D But yeah ..
Yes , I did ! It's a lot of work but worth the payoff when done right :D
I'm sure he'll be back with a vengeance soon enough !
I'm sure he's got a pair of those in his closet somewhere ...
I loved wall e . I was so sad when it ended ... but the ending is still great !
I was thinking that too ! I'm not sure why it's so hard for people ...
I'm aware but I was just saying it's not unheard of for a colony like ours to have some sort or animal in there who needs help with something important ...
I'll PM you my PayPal info , thanks !
Happy birthday ! I'm turning 18 in a few days , and my birth year is also 9 11 ' 97 ... so close yet far away :D Happy Birthday to you too !
He doesn't want a ring . He just wanted some money and that was his motivation for leaving Cleveland last year I believe ?
I think that's what happened . They just didn't have enough time to do it in a timely manner , so they had no choice but to remove all of them ! :D D: lt 3
I think it's pretty cool , but I'm not sure if the idea is actually interesting or just a fun thing for kids who don't know what they're doing ... ? :P Edit spelling ! D: D DD
I'm not saying they're stronger , I just think that's what we should be doing instead of trying to make them more durable or something like that ... ? :P Edit spelling ! D: lt
Thanks for pointing that out ! I was confused by it too at first and thought they were talking about an Icelandic company or something ...
He's the best spider man ever ... and he knows it too ..
I think you mean cancel .
I'm sure they'll find something else that's better than this one ...
He's the best looking man in all of sports . I'm sure you've seen him before , but that hairline makes me think otherwise ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I hope it's sarcasm because that is a really good quote and I love this movie so much ! :D
I'm not sure what this means , but I agree with the sentiment of your comment !
I'm pretty sure that's a quote from The Office .
I'm feeling pretty good about it , but I don't know if that's a bad thing or not ...
I'm a big fan of the new album by Kavinsky . It's got some great songs and is very catchy !
You're not alone , brother !
I've been doing this for years , but I'm not sure if it's working ...
I was thinking that too , but I think it's more like a combination between the two factions from Halo 3 and Reach .
I've come to barga !
He's a good defensive coordinator , he just doesn't know how the offense works and his scheme isn't suited for him at all yet in terms of personnel or coaching style ...
I'm pretty sure that's what he was doing . He had a lot of pressure on the blade and didn't want to stand up for some reason ...
I don t know . I just thought that was a cool idea and wanted some more info on how they did this ! Thanks for your input though :D lt 3
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I think it's pretty clear he understands what we are doing , and why this would be bad for us all ! :D D: lt 3 u bbzkitties 2u2e3d4a5c6f737
You're a good man !
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry at this ...
That's awesome ! I'm glad you enjoyed it , but that doesn't mean they didn t have fun making it :D
It's not like they're going to be throwing them at the ground , either ...
I'm glad you enjoyed it ! I hope your experience is as good or better than mine was when i started in high school ...
I'm not judging , I just want to know . It's a good question for the community though so it should be answered in some way or another by now ! :D Thanks OP lt 3
Number of years they've been in the conference .
I'm sorry , but I don't understand what you're trying so hard at ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I hope it's sarcasm , but that seems a little too specific for me to be able to tell from your comment .. ? lol ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
I'm a big fan of both , but it's definitely more like an eggy mixture than anything else ...
They did , but it was a screen pass to Baldwin and he got stuffed by his own lineman on that play ...
I think it's more of an emotional relationship than anything else ... but I agree that they're both awful people who should never be together in any way shape or form ! :P lt 3
I think it was a clear penalty , but I don't know if the refs saw that or not ...
A strong one ! :D I'm just kidding though , it would have been funny to see them all go through the same groups as Portugal did last year lolololo XD xDD D: lt
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but that movie was a masterpiece in my opinion and it's one of the best movies ever made ! It really is amazing ...
I think you mean'The Void ' ...
I've been to both , and I prefer Skylons . The Hub is a bit more expensive though ...
I'm from Toronto and I've never seen snow like that before ! It's amazing how much it melts away over a few days of no rain or wind ...
I'm sure you can find a better one . I've been using the same playlist for years and it's still working just fine ! :D
And then I take a loan and pay it back to him , because that's how you repay debt ! s
I'm crying right now .
I was thinking that too , but I'm not sure if it's just because they're dressed as women or what ...
I am the one who knocks .
Or both !
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this comment ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I hope so ! :D
I think that was the first time . I remember him doing it in his second term , but not for president or anything like that ... maybe something else though ! :P Edit spelling error .. lolololloloooloo
I would also like a link , please and thank you :D
I'm pretty sure he is in the movie ... but not as a character or anything like that ! He was just there for some reason ? Maybe it had something to do with his name .. lolololllll :D D: lt 3333c3y0m4n5h8e7d6b2f9a1bbbeeejkzwqgdfsxv
He told him that Russia was a great place and they should be proud of it .
I'm in the UK and I've never heard of this , is it something specific to us ? Or just common sense for everyone else ? Thanks !
I think it's more about how much of that money goes to charity .
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I'll take it as a compliment ! :D Thanks for the heads up though ...
I'm not your doctor , but that's a pretty good guess !
I'm sure you can . Just don't be a bad person and it's all good ! :D
He's dead , but not in this film . He was just an extra for some scenes and is now back to being a ghost or something like that ...
I'm glad he's doing well ! He was the best of his kind , and we had no idea what happened until it got too cold for him ...
I think you mean 5,000 , 000,00 and not 6,500 ...
He's not even that bad of an actor though ... He could've done better than this ! s I'm sorry but you're right about him being terrible as president tho ..
I think it was just an attempt to be funny , but I'm not sure if that's what he meant by the word persuasion ... or maybe they were trying too hard ! :P
I'll be sure to keep an eye out for ya . I'm not a member of the group though so don't worry about it :P
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this comment ...
I'm not sure if you're serious , but he's dead now ...
I think it's just because they're so rare and expensive , but if you have one of those cars with an engine swap or something like this ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that he's gone . He was my favorite player growing up , and now it seems like his career is over ... sigh ..
And Super Metroid .
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but I think he's actually the director for this movie ... so it could be him ! :D Edit : spelling error fixed that part lolololoolllll
Because he's a clone of Spider Man .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that they didn't do a whole lot with it , but at least we got some closure on what happened ! :D
You're right , I'm wrong on all of those things ! Thanks for the correction though :D
The one that's not the Jets .
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or bad . But thanks anyway lol
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I agree with your sentiment and would like to see the end of it as well !
I'm pretty sure that was his plan . He wanted to do it so bad but couldn't find any good footage of him doing it lol !
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I think it's pretty funny and interesting to see how people react when they get banned for something like this ...
I'm not a bot ! I just like to be called that sometimes ...
done upvote me back pls thx !
She's probably a fan of the show . She just doesn't know what to do with her hands and feet when she sees it lol !
We're not even close to being that bad yet ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic . I hope it's sarcasm , because that would be hilarious ! But seriously ... call them and report back to us ?
He's the best player in our history , but he is not Prime Process material like some of these guys are ...
I m sorry for your loss , man !
I think he's just trying not get the camera in front of him and it looks like he is going for an awkward pose instead ... but I could be wrong ! :D Edit : spelling error fixed , thanks u nyantip 1.5 Nyancoins verify ?
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this is my first time doing it .
You're gonna need a lot of help from your teammates to do that , but you'll get there !
I'd take that in a heartbeat . I think it's the perfect fit for him personally but we'll see how long his career lasts before people start hating on him again lololollolo ! s
I think you mean ronaldo quas m8 ? ! s
You could use them to cut your nails and get some extra time on the job !
I agree with you on that one ! It is just an example for anyone who wants something similar in their backyard or somewhere else they can live out there ...
I thought they were just a bunch of little sea monsters . I was like , oh no ! Then I saw this and got sad again ...
I'm not saying you should go to theaters ... But if it's your first time going there and they're showing LOTR or something like that then yeah definitely don't ! :P lol jk lt 3333
No , no es tim hortos !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling ... but I'll take it as a compliment ! :D
I don't have a Twitter . I'm not even sure what that means , but okay ?
I'm with you on that one ...
I'm going to be honest with you and say that I was expecting a lot more than this ... but it is still pretty good !
I'm not sure if I should be worried or excited .
I don t know about other countries like Canada or Australia where we have laws against this sort of thing ... But yeah there s no way for us Canadians either ! :P lolololoolloohhahahahaahhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa haha XD lt 3rds
Because they're not a threat to anyone . They are just people trying their best for you and your family , but that's about all I can think off ...

I have an upstairs balcony . I don't want to be seen watching my cat's sleep on it all day long !
I'm glad to hear it ! It's one of my favorite titles ever and the way he describes his experience is so relatable for me as well :D Thanks again ! lt 3
It happens in the US too . I've seen a few of these videos on youtube that are from other countries as well but they're not nearly as bad here ... yet ! :D Edit spelling error ..
I'm sure they have some sort of security system in place for that purpose , but you'd be surprised how many people don't know about them and just go around with their stuff ... :P ! Haha ..
I'm sure they'll be fine , but I'd like a warning before it's too late ! :D
Or just shoot them in their eyes and ears , or whatever they do for funsies ...
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I agree with your sentiment nonetheless !
I'm not sure what you mean by that ? Are there any examples of this happening in the past or are we just assuming it's a thing now because they're Jews ... oh wait .. nvm ! s
I've never heard of it before but I'm sure there are some people who have and they're right about it being pretty bad for your ears ...
He's still the head coach of that team , so he gets a pass on this one ! s Edit : I'm not sure why people are downvoting me for asking an honest question ...
I think you mean drowned .
Mine too !
I think you mean dystopia ...
I know , right ? ! It's so sad ... but it was a good laugh too :D
A place where people are paid to be a part time employee .
It's a repost , so it doesn't count as an original article and therefore no one will report the story to the mods for being misleading or inaccurate ... ? I donno .. shrugs It was just interesting though ! :D lt 3 u bbzkittles
I'm sure his wife is a huge fan of him as well !
I'm sorry , I didn't know there was a price list on here ! Will be more careful next time :D Thanks again !
I think you guys are going for at least 9 wins this year so far ...
I'm sure he's already loaded , just waiting for the right moment ...
I'm not sure if it's because they're all so stupid or what but our military is pretty bad and has been for quite some time ... edit :
He's a good guy . He just doesn't have any money to pay for his own lawyers , so he has an agent who helps him out in this case !
I think you mean irony .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but I think the answer is both ! :D
You're a good man !
I'm sure you're right , I just don't think that the media would have been able too much more than what they did with this story if he hadn t done anything wrong ... ? ! s Edit : grammar
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of the title ... but I think it's funny either way ! :P
I'm not saying you will . But if the earth was only 6000 million billion years old then there would be no reason to believe that humans have existed for longer than 100,000 ? ! s ... wait a minute .. lol jk :P
The first one is still my favorite of the series , but I'm not sure if it's a reboot or just an extended cut ...

They're not even trying to hide it anymore ... I'm surprised that's still going on !
I'm sure they would have been fine with a few extra dollars in their pocket , but I doubt it was an economic issue at all ...
Like Michael Cera in The Office !
He knew it wasn't a touchdown , but didn t want to risk getting his hopes up and then losing them again in overtime ...
I'm pretty sure that's already been confirmed .
I'm not sure if this is a joke or not , but I think it's funny because of the way he said that ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll but I like it :D
I'm sure he'll be back in some form or another , but not for long !
I'm going to the same one next week and I'll be there with you guys too :D
You're a hero !
I'm not saying it was her fault but I think that is a pretty good age to be in love with someone who looks like you and acts exactly like you do ... ? ! :P Edit : grammar
I'm sure it will be a great movie , but I don t think the story is going anywhere anytime soon ...
You're right , I'm a better driver than this guy ! s
I think it's a great movie , but I don't know if he could have pulled off the role of a young Bruce Willis in that one ...
You can't just say that and not give us some context . I'm confused now ...
I thought I was going crazy .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is happening .
Because they're not good enough . They have a lot of talent , but their coach isn't very good at managing them and the team doesn t seem to gel well together ... yet ! :P Edit spelling error ..
They're not playing in OT . They play a game of football , and they lose it all at some point during regulation or extra time periods .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is happening , but it's definitely a good thing for us to see ! :D
I think it was a woman .
He's only 26 , so I'd say about 3 more seasons at least ! He'll be 29 in September though ...
Ramos was already on the ground . He just got up and went to get his arms back , but he didn't even touch him before getting down again ...
The Packers are my second favorite NFL team . The only one that comes close is the Bears , but they're not even a real rival anymore ... yet !
I'm sorry but you have been outbid by u jayybee for a group of 100 people who are all in this thread now :P Sorry about that though ...
He's not going anywhere lol he has a ring and is still playing at an all star level for his team ... He'll be fine !
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think that's actually an actual quote from John Wick .
I'm not sure what you mean by that ... but thanks for the feedback !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take it as sarcasm anyway ! :D
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I think it is more like 1.00 for consumers and 2,50 3k for businesses ? Not 100 though ! Edit : typo error on my end lolololloloooloo
It's not . It is just an illusion created by Photoshop , but it looks like he has some sort of tattoo on his arm or something ... I don't know what though ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolololloloooloo
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
I'm sure he was just trying to help . I mean , it worked for him ! s
I think it's a rule that if someone posts anything , they must be able and willing . I don t know how long this has been in place though ... maybe forever or so .. lol ! :P Edit spelling error xD sorry guys D: lt 3 u bbz 2k17
I'm not saying it does , but I think that's what he was trying for when he said this ...
I think it was a joke . He is playing Genie , but they are just showing him as Will Smith because of his role on The Wire and such ...
I'm pretty sure that was the first time I ever saw him pitch , and he did it in his sleep !
Porque se puede ser que te va a ver . No hay problemas , pero si es lo mismo consejo ... y la gente de los d as le hab an lado en el pais !
It's a shame because it had potential but the writing and acting were just terrible in season 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82
I'm not sure if you're serious , but it's because of the new IP and the fact that they are both Marvel properties now ...
I'm with you on this one ! Breakfast is my favorite meal of all time and it's not even close ... but then again , who doesn't love a good egg ? :P lolololllll
You can change that in the settings ! I think we're going with a more generic name for now though ...
I'm a big fan of their stuff ! I've got some more on my instagram : www.insta.com jonnyjonesmusic
I'm gonna delete the post , but I'll be sure to tell my friends about your comment so they can see how much gold we have ! Thanks guys lt 3
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take your word for it because that's what my brain says anyway ...
I'm not sure if this is a joke or not but it's funny because the name of my favorite movie was Star Wars : The Phantom Menace and now its called Star Wars Episode IV ... ? !
I think that's what they were going to do , but then he got distracted and left .
You're not alone !
I'm not sure if it's a joke or not but he did say “ Gold Train Fail ” and then edited his comment after getting downvoted for saying something different ... so maybe just an edit mistake .. idk lololollolooolooohhahahahaha haaa lt 3rdsrsgjfldlwoooooowwwewepprzdgeeeehhhbzzss
I'd buy it .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I agree with both of your statements , and would like to add that the Internet also has no power over me ! :D lt 3 u bbzkittles 2u2c3r4s1e5d8a7f9g6hqwjnxv
I'd play it . I'm not sure if that's what you're asking for though ...
I loved that part too ! It's one of my favorite scenes from the movie , and it really shows how much Lucas has changed since then :D
Go ahead . It's not like it matters anyway , but go for it ! :D
I'm sure you could find a way to get around that , but I don't think the government would like your body parts getting in their way ...
I'm pretty sure that was just an urban legend and not actually true ... but I could be wrong ! :P But yeah he did have them there for some reason lolololoolllll ..
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think that's a reference to the movie The Lizards .
I was thinking the same thing , but I think it's just an old water tower that got knocked down and replaced with something else ... or maybe they're both in there ? ! Haha :D
I think you mean there was no .
I'm pretty sure that's not true , but I don't know enough about him to dispute it ...
I think she's fine , but I'm not sure if it was a good idea to nerf the damage of her ulti and then buffed her W .
He's a troll . He doesn't care about the truth , he just wants attention and likes being on TV for some reason ... I'm not sure what that has anything do with it though .. ? ! s
You're a good son , Dad !
He can't be that big . He is a giant , I'm pretty sure his arms reach the ceiling of my house ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll . Either way I laughed at your username and upvoted for the laugh alone !
I'm Australian but I've never heard of this before ! What's it called ?
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling but I think that's actually true ... bears have no fear of women and they can't be scared by men either ! s
I'm from Destino too ! I've never seen it this bad before though ...
I do , but only because of how much he's been a part in our success this season and his legacy as an all time great player to boot ! s
I've never had a Kangaroo , I'll have to look into it ! Thanks for your input though :D
I think there's a couple of them from the Netherlands too !
I have a few of those but not the others sorry !
I think it's a broken wrist , but I'm not sure if the swelling is from being hit in the face or something else .
I think it's more like a giant needle with eyes on both sides ... I could be wrong though ! :P But yeah not good for your vision either lolololoolllll
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've never seen anyone use the word'mace'in this context before ...
You should be able too ! I'm at about 50 now ... but it's not like you can't do anything else while working :P
I'm sure you could find a sub that is just as good .
I'm sure they'll be able get it back in the next few years with all of their money from selling ads and such ...
It's a quote from the movie , not an original line by him in the book .
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but I think he's being facetious ...
I'm sure you can find one for less than 100 bucks on eBay or Amazon right now ...
I think the generators are more likely to be used by people who don't have electricity or want something else that's not coal powered ... like solar power plants ! :D
I'm sure you can find some ancient texts online that will help with the knowledge and context needed to understand this thought process !
I'm not sure if I should be excited or sad that it exists ...
I'm not sure what you're talking about ... He was one step away from war on drugs ! s
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry ...
I think he could pull off a good Spidey and not have to deal too many of those pesky plot holes .
He's a good player , but he needs to be more consistent and not get injured so often like that last game against Atletico Madrid ...
I think it's more of a feeling that you're not happy , but rather sad because your body is trying to make up for the lack in happiness by making itself unhappy ? Idk ... shrugs
It's a hoodie , I think ? It was on sale at the store that day and he got one for Christmas or something like that lol !
I'm sure it'll be on his Twitter feed by tomorrow morning ... I mean , you know what they say about people who don t use twitter ? They re not very good at social media ! s
The only one I can think of that comes close would be'You're not my supervisor ! ' , but it's probably too long and doesn't really fit with her personality at all ... :P Edit : spelling error fixed
He's also in The Martian and he was great on that movie ! I'm excited for him to get more roles after his success with The Martian . He really deserves them now though ... lol :D lt 3
I'm pretty sure that's what happened to CLG . They had a lot of problems with their ADC and they were forced into subs for him , but still ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling . I don't think he's fat though ... maybe it was a joke ? :P But yeah that would be my guess as well ! Thanks for the info guys .. lolz xD lt 3 u 2 bb xxoxxxxo
You don't . It's just an animation glitch that happens when the player is stunned by a knockback or something like that , and it doesn t actually happen in game . :P
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious . If so ... well then yes ! :D
I'm not your boy , buddy .
I'm not telling him anything . He's just asking a question and getting an answer from someone who knows more than he does about the subject matter of this sub ...
To get people to watch . It's not like they're going out and buying tickets or anything ... it just makes them feel better about themselves , which I think that counts for something ? ! s
I'm pretty sure he got fired for it , but yeah ...
Lonzo is a good kid , but I think his dad was more concerned with making sure that they didn't get into trouble and not getting caught up in it later on ... ? idk .. lolololoolllll ! srsly tho lmaooooloooowwwwwwwooooooshhhahahahaahhhaaawwhaaatttt
I think it's because of how many times he missed . He was wide open , but didn't get a shot off in time for his teammates'feet or anything like that .. lol ! :D lt 3
Sorry , I didn't see that when i posted it ! Will do next time :D Thanks for letting me know though and sorry again about not reading your rules before posting ...
I'm sure they're just going through a phase of grief and are trying their best not too be burned by it , but still ...
I think I watched it at least once a year for the first 3 years of my life . It's still one that gets me every time ! :D lt 3333333333 3 3333
I'm so excited for this ! I can't wait . It's gonna have the best soundtrack of any film ever made , and it'll probably be amazing at the theater too :D DDDddd daaaaaaaddddddduuuudeee
It wasn t , but it s not like he could have been any worse than the other two characters in that movie anyway ...
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this is a thing .
I was born on 9 11 2001 and I'm still not a citizen ...
He's been playing great lately too ! I'm really excited to see him develop into a consistent player in the future and hopefully he can stay healthy for us next season ...
It's a common mistake , but it makes sense in this context because of the way they're pronounced and their meaning to be used together .
I think it's more likely that he thought about what to do and decided not too much of anything would happen if he didn't get away with this one ...
He's going for a third term . He'll be the first president of Canada , and he will make sure that we're not forgotten by history !
I am 6 ' 2 with long hair but no makeup on my face ... so yes ! :D
You're a good man , Brent !
I'm not a guy , so I don't know if this is true . But my friend who was diagnosed with Bipolar also had the same experience as you ! It's definitely possible though ... ? :D Edit : spelling error fixed lolololoolllllzzzzyyyyuuuupsss
I'm pretty sure that's what happened .
I loved lich king , but i think that's because people were expecting a new one to be released in like 5 years or something ...
He's a real trooper . I hope he gets to wear it again in the playoffs !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic but I'll take your word on that one :P
I'm at 7 . I think it was a good day for me !
I was just trying out some new things and wanted feedback from people who have been there before ! I'm not really sure what else is going through my mind lol :P Thanks though man lt 3
Buy a house . Rent one for the rest of your days and enjoy it while you can !
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ... but it is definitely both ! :D
I think it's a good idea , but I don t know if they can do that in time for the show to start or not ...
I think TL is the best team in NA right now . They are just so good at everything and have a lot of potential to be really strong teams next season ! :D DD
He was the only guy who could get to him and make it look like an accident , which is what I think everyone else wanted .
I'd rather not have my beer stolen , but I'm sure that's what they're thinking too ...
I'm pretty sure it's a reference to the movie The Raid : Redemption .
I'm glad it's not just me ! :D Thanks for posting this , though !
I'm not sure what that means , but I'll take it as a compliment ! Thanks for your input though :D lt 3
INTP here too :D I'm a bit of an ENFJ though ...
I'm sure he's a great guy . I hope we can get him to do an AMA here in r politics sometime ! He'd be perfect as our new leader ...
I'm hoping for the same thing ! Thanks again and good luck with your project :D lt 3
I'm pretty sure they did it to avoid the snow storm that hit Omaha last year and ended up being a disaster for everyone involved ...
He's in the next one , but it doesn't have anything to do with this movie ... yet ! :D
I'm a manager now !
I think it's the hair . It looks so much better than his usual look , and I'm not even sure why ... but that is what makes him stand out to me more now :D lt 3
It's not like he was going around saying that it wasn't his fault or anything ... It just didn'seem right at the moment and now we're all on board with him ! ? s
I don t think she s a very good actress . I ve seen her in other movies and it was just not that great to me , but this one is different ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this comment ...
I'm not sure if they're on netflix but I've seen a few of them and it is definitely worth checking out !
I'm sure that's what the mods are doing right now , but I don't think they're going to do it for him until after his next game starts ...
I'd say frost , but you can't go wrong with either of them !
He's a beast at it , but he doesn't have to be in coverage if there is no one open ...
I think you mean Seppuku . It's a Japanese martial art that involves the use of swords to cut through people with knives or other weapons .
I think that's a cat .
I think it was a joke . I'm not sure though ...
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this is the first time someone has ever said something like this to me on here ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious . Either way , it's true for both teams this year so far !
I think it's more that they wanted to have a female lead in this one and she was too old at the time ... so there wasn't much choice ? :P Edit spelling ! D: D DD
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... I hope it's sarcasm because this is a really good point to make ! :D Thanks for sharing though lt 3
I agree completely ! I'm not sure why people are so against it ... but they're just being petty about the whole thing ..
I think you mean Ray Lewis style , but I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ...
I'm pretty sure they're still allowed , but you can only use them for cosmetic items like cosmetics cards etc ...
I think they're just really good at bird law , but I could be totally off base on that one ...
I've had that happen before ... I'm not sure if it's just me or what but when my wife orders something and she gets an extra large , I get really nervous ! :P lolololloloopsieshouldknow.jpg ? XD
I'm sure you'll be fine , but it's a good reminder ! Good luck on your recovery :D
I'm not sure about that one ... maybe the Bucks or something like that .. idk lol i was thinking more along those lines though ! haha sorry for being so vague :P good luck with your future endeavors tho man lt 3333 m8 xDxDDXdYhZzSrsHwEbKsUgTmVlLfM
I'm not 100 on this one ... But it's definitely illegal in some states if you're working more than 7 hours per week or something like that .. Not really though haha :P Edit spelling error fixed now xD Thanks guys lt 3 uuuuuhhhahahaha XD D
I think he's going to be great , I'm excited for him ! He was also really good on The Wire and is an excellent actor too ...
It's a win for me ! :D
You're not my supervisor ! You can't do anything about it . I'll be here for the next few weeks , though ...
I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing ... I think it depends on how much of an egoist you are , but yeah , probably both ? :P
I think it's because of his hair , but I could be wrong ! :D He does look a lot like him though ...
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've heard that it's actually better to take the Vitamin C supplement than the Kool aid one because of how much more soluble vitamins are ! ? ...
I'm pretty sure that's a different school entirely though ...
I think it's a reference to the fact that he is wearing his own outfit . He just has no idea what he looks like in game lolololoolllloooooooolooo ! XD xD
I'm sure he's not going for a trade war with China . He'll just make them pay more in taxes than they already do anyway ! s
I'm sure it's going to be cheaper than the original price of the tooth .
I think it's a wig , but I could be wrong !
I'm not a celebrity , I just have an opinion on the subject matter of this subreddit ...
Because they're made for men . Women wear size 12 shoes , and men wear 10 11 or 9.5 .
I'm okay with this . I want them so bad but they're not going anywhere anytime soon and it's a great team that can win championships agains any other teams too ! s
I think you mean mid life crisis ?
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious . But it's a good thing to know about the products they sell because of their reputation as well ... right ? Right guys .. srsly lolololllzzzzzzzZZZsRrrrRRgSsshhYyyyBbEeeeHhNnLmFwGdUuWqDkT 9xQcKpVf7vX
You're right , I'm not sure what's happening in my head but it doesn't seem like a good idea at all ...
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry at this comment ...
I think she was trying to be a bit more relaxed , but I don't know how that would work out for me ... :P
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take it as sarcasm and upvote anyway ! :D
Same here , I was like ... what is this guy doing ? ! Then I remembered that it's not a real person so there wasn't much to fear lololollolo
I have a foot pedal for that too ! I use it all day long when I'm not at home or in my car ...
I'm pretty sure that's a woman .
He was a great actor and I think that the show has helped him get better at it as well ! He just doesn t have any range anymore ... lolololoolllll :D D: lt 3
We can't have a double . We need to go deeper !
I'm not sure if I should be proud or sad that we're the only ones who can do this .
I think it's the same guy . I'm pretty sure that was his first time using an axe , and then they cut him off in half .
I'm not sure , but I think it's safe . You can't get high on your own supply of drugs and alcohol in the ocean ! s
I think the late 90 ' s and early 00 ' s are where most of that started . I remember downloading a lot more songs in those years than now , though ...
I've seen a few , but I'm not sure if they're legit .
I'm sure that's what happened in this case , but I don t think it s a good thing to say about someone who was just arrested ... ? It seems like an odd comparison .. lol ! :P Edit spelling error fixed now hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhheeeehee heeeeeehhhhhhhh
He's just misunderstood and he doesn't deserve it , but I think that is what makes him such an interesting character in my opinion ! He has his own personality too ... lol .. :D lt 3
I'm a fisherman and I can confirm this is true ! Source : am not an oceanologist but have been to many oceans ...
I'm pretty sure that's a lie and you're just trying too hard for some karma ... but I'll upvote anyway !
I think he'll be fine . He was a great player and I'm sure the team would love to have him back in their locker room after this season is over ! s Edit : typo error ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it's a good thing that she is so thin and has such an attractive body shape ! She looks great too ...
I think it was more so that they were a way for people who had no other option but revolt .
I think that's the point of a movie like this ... to make you feel uncomfortable in some way ! I'm not sure why though .. maybe because they're trying too hard ? :P lolololllll XD xD lt 3
Because it's a joke .
I think you mean blind man , but I'm not sure ...
The world needs an armageddon .
I'm sure it's a good thing you don't live in Florida , then ! :P I'd be terrified of getting wet there ...
I'm going out tonight , so hopefully it'll be there by then ! :D
You don't , but I'm sure they have a way to remove them from their food source if needed ...
I'm sorry for your loss of freedom and liberty to live in an oppressive society like America ! I hope we can all come together as one nation again soon ... someday .. ?
I'm a scientist and this was my first thought as well !
I'm sure you can find a way to make money off of MTG , but I doubt it will be as lucrative for them if they do that ...
Happy Birthday ! :D
I'm not sure if that sub is a joke or just an elaborate troll . Either way it was funny though ! Thanks for the recommendation :D
She's a millionaire now , but she wasn't when I met her in the first place !
It's a good thing I'm not driving in that area then ! :P But yeah , it would be nice to have some protection against those pesky cars ...
I'm curious too ! :D
I'm sure he's got some kind of mental illness that makes him act out his way around the house ... but it would make me feel better if you did ! :D lt 3 u bbzombie
I did that , but it still doesn't work ... I'm not sure what to do now .. :P Thanks for your help though !
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I don't think it's true for all of them ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but I think it's funny that this is the first time anyone has ever heard of an ant giving medicine ... ? ! :D D:
Yeah , I've heard good things about Mutems too ! Thanks man :D
I think it's a good price , but I'm not sure if that is what you were expecting from him writing this book ...
I'm going for that one , too ! I'll be sure to tell him about your advice when he gets home from school tomorrow morning ... :D lt 3 u bbzkitties
I don't think so . I've had mine for a few years and they're still pretty good , but it's not like the battery is going to die anytime soon ... yet ! lolololllll XD xD lt 3333
I'm not sure what your point was but I'll take it anyway ! Thanks Obama ... wait no thanks .
PM sent !
Hawaii is the best ! I'm from there too :D
I think you mean the matrix is a simulation of your brain and not real life !
I think he was trying to get him in position for his backflip . He didn't realize that would be an issue with red pajamas , though ...
I'm sure you'd have a lot more fun with him as your team's backup QB , though ...
He's not the one who made it though ...
I think it means that he's not going anywhere . He'll be back in Madrid next season and they're gonna need him for a while longer than we do now anyway ...
It's not , but it looks like one to me ! I'm pretty sure the guy in front of him has some sorta weird face or something though ... ?
I would love a sub ! I'm new here and have no idea what's going on but if anyone has any questions feel free ask me :D Thanks for the offer though !
I'm on about 45 , but it's been a while since the last one so maybe that is why ...
You should probably get that checked out , man !
I'm sure he'll get there eventually ... I mean comeon man .. He has like 3 kids now ?
I'm not too familiar with the UK education system so I can't comment about it sorry ! But yeah that's a good idea for kids to learn from their teachers :D Thanks though lt 3
I think it's more the fact they're not good at dancing . They don't have a lot to work with and their bodies aren t built for it yet ...
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ...
I think it's just the texture of their skin ... but that could be because my mom is Jewish so she eats kosher food all the time lol ! :P haha sorry for your loss man .. lt 3 hugs hugzieshugsheeeeeezzieeeeshhugsssingshitmebackbabyshitmebacksnowsatemaybeatsickles xDxDDXdxdxcuseycrieslurrrrryyydditnggg
Done.back to me , thx !
I'm still waiting for a chair to be used in smash 4 , but I think we're all just gonna wait until they announce it at E3 or something like this ... :P Edit : spelling error ! D: lt 3
I think it's more like , if you're not a spy or an enemy soldier then your life is in danger .
You're a towel ! You wash your hands after every use of soap and water ?
Because he's not human . He is an alien that has been created by the gods to destroy all life on earth and create his own universe .
I've heard of it , but I haven't gotten around to reading it yet ! Thanks for reminding me about that one though :D
I'm sure he has plenty more than one dollar in his bank account ...
We are one ! We're the 1 ... and they're not even close to being that many people in our country :P I'm so happy for you guys too lt 3
Reminding you is a good idea . I'll be sure to remind myself ! :D Thanks for the reminder , and thanks again for your help with this project ! lt 3
You're not in the top 10 of NZ , but you are on our list ! :D
I think it was in the movie The Last Samurai .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . Either way it's hilarious and makes me laugh every time he says that line lolololoolllll ...
I'm not sure if I should be offended or happy that this is the top comment ...
The spinning back kick .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I upvoted anyway , so thanks ! :D
I'm sure there's a lot of them out there but it doesn t mean that the majority is going to buy one or two ... just saying .. lol ! :D
I'm not sure if this is true but I've heard that the best way to learn how to play guitar was by playing with your dad .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that we're going to have a game like this . It's just too much fun !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I'll take your word for it , but that's a pretty big stretch to make up in one sentence ...
I'm sure they care more than you think , but I don't know how much of it matters if the majority doesn t like what s happening in the world anymore ... ? ! :D D: dddd
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a joke . I'll take it as sarcasm , though ! :D
I'm sure they'll be remembered for the same reason we are : being a good person and not getting into trouble with the law or anything like that ! s
Technically correct the best kind !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I agree with your sentiment and would like to see the replay of this call in a few minutes !
He was a good guy in his day but I don t think that s what you re looking for when it comes down to politics today ...
I'll have a go at it . It will be delicious !
I'm a fan of his too . He's just so ... different from everyone else , and he has some great lines in that show ! I love it when they do him like this though :D lt 3
I'm pretty sure that's not what happened , but I could be wrong about this one ...
I've never had Annie's Mac amp Cheese but I'll have to give it another go ! Thanks for your suggestion :D
They're all gone , and I'm out of here !
I'm aware of that but I think there are some similarities in terms if story and characters so maybe we'll see them both adapted into one series ? ! :D
I think it's pretty cool . It makes me feel like I'm part of something special and important , even if its just for one day or two at most ! :D lt 3
I think he means the ones that have been around for decades , not just recently .
I'm sure they're just as happy to have a new baby than I am !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , but this is exactly what happened with my old housemate's fridge and he had no idea how long his refrigerator was there until we moved ! :D D: lt 3
I think it was a lot more than just Germans . I'm sure there are many other countries who would cheer for someone like this to crash into their cars too ! s
I'm sure you'll find it in your inbox . I just got one myself !
It's not , but it'll be a lot more fun to watch if they do that instead of the usual Marvel movies with their stupid plot twists and all ... :P !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I think caffeine can be used as a stimulant in some cases ? Not that there's anything wrong with that ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolololoolllll
I'm a bot , what did you expect !
I think you're right , but it's still funny to see the reaction from people who don't know what they are talking about when someone says something like this ...
I think he means a camp for kids who are too young and don't want their parents'attention , but still have friends in jail or something like that ... ? :P Edit spelling ! D: lt 3
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but I think it's pretty clear that this was a joke ... ?
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is happening , but it's definitely a good thing to happen in the end ! :D
I think I read somewhere that there's going be an HD remake of star field . So maybe not too far off ? :D
I'm not a fan but it's still one of my favorite movies !
I think it's a combination . I'm not sure though , but he has some adamantic properties in the comics and movies too so maybe that is what they were going for ! :D DDDddd ...
I'm not sure if I want to know what happened in this movie , but it's definitely worth watching for those reasons alone !
And a few other countries in Europe that aren't part EU member states ...
Thanks a lot , I'll be waiting :D
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or just ignorant but I don't think that's true for all Russians ...
I'm sure you could have done it with a few minutes of effort , but I don't think that's what OP is asking for ...
I've never heard that before , but it sounds delicious !
LeBron James and The Cleveland Cavaliers
I'm sure it's been done before , but I don't think anyone would believe that the original was in fact real ...
I think it's safe to say that he didn't make a lot more money than he should have from this film ... but I'm no critic so take my opinion with a grain of salt ! :P lol .. haha hahaha XD xD LOL
I'm sorry for your loss , but you're not alone in this . It's a sad time and it will be okay soon enough !
The only bins I've ever seen are on the ground floor at my local station ... and they're all empty !
You mean the British spelling of'bin man'isn t called that in America either ...
That's a good point ! I didn't consider that possibility at all ... but it makes sense now :P Thanks for your input though !
I'm not sure if you're serious , but that's exactly what happened with Atlantis and all those other places too ...
I think you mean good dog , not a good human being ... but I'm no expert on dogs and their behavior so take that with a grain of salt ! :P Edit : Spelling error fixed it's all the same thing really ? Haha ..
I'm sure he was thinking of the people who were forced to work for him in his time as a farmer and fisherman ...
I'm not sure what you're trying here but I think it's a reference from the movie The Interview where they all speak Russian in an interview .
You're a good parent ! I hope you have an awesome day tomorrow night :D
I think you're right about that ! I'll edit my post with a few more details in an hour or so ... Thanks again :D
I'm sure it's a lot more than just the water bill , but I'd imagine they're not getting paid for this either way ...
I'm sure they'll be fine with me voting for them again , but I don't think it's a good idea either ...
And eat all that sweet karma ! :D DDDddd daaaaaaad ... I'm sorry for what happened last night ..
I think it's more about how they're not getting calls . They get a lot less than other players because there are no fouls called on their shots or anything like that lol .. smh ! srsly tho :P Edit : spelling error fixed hahaahahaahahhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
It's a good thing you don't have any friends then , because that would be an awful idea ...
He is also very smart and has good instincts , so he will probably be able to survive in this environment for quite some time ! :D
The Browns . They've had a few bad ones this year , but they're still in it for that one game where their kicker got injured and missed two games ...
I think he's going for the record , but I'm not sure if it'll count as a win or lose ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I think it's a good thing that this isn't happening right now , because then we'd have to deal with climate change ! s ? :P Edit : spelling error fixed .. thanks guys lolololllllz lt 3 u bb
I think he's a great actor , but I don't know if his performance in The Fly is up there with some of his other performances for me personally ...
I'm not sure what that means , but it sounds delicious !
I've done this before . It's a great way to get your mind off things , though I'm not sure if it works for everyone ...
Because they're the best team in Europe . They've been playing great football for years and are very good at it as well ! s
I think you mean : what is this thing called an octopus in your pocket ! ? I don't know why but ...
I'd say he's up there with Klay and Draymond , but not quite as good at it yet imo ...
You are not safe from the internet ! You have to make a new account and log out of your old one first before commenting again ...
I'm not sure what that has anything do with the fact I was being judged , but okay ...
I'm 16 and have been doing it since high school . It's not a bad thing to do if you're comfortable with your age group of friends or whatever they are called ! Good luck man :D lt 3
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but that's a great movie !
I'm sure you're a great person and all but I don t think Russia is the one who should be blamed here ...
He's probably still in denial about it , but he has no reason not too be angry at himself for being so wronged by this whole thing ...
I'm with you on that one ... it's just so ridiculous and stupid to me !
I think that's what they were trying to do , but it didn't work out so well for them ...
She's a keeper ! I'm sure she'll be thrilled to have him back soon , too ...
I'm hoping for a young Sean Bean as well !
I don't think that's what they were going with ... but it was an interesting thought experiment nonetheless ! :D
I think the statistic was that there are only 6 unsolved homicides in total per 100k people and all those cases have been solved by now ... so not really a huge difference .. :P Edit spelling error lolololoolllll
It's a good way to get the audience involved in what is essentially an action movie , which can be very effective for marketing purposes if done right ! :D
I think he's going to be a good guy , but not necessarily evil or anything like that ... just more of an anti hero type character who is also super smart and resourceful ! :D lt 3
I've tried that but it doesn't work for me : I'm not sure why ... maybe because of my settings ? It's just too much effort ! Thanks though ..
I'm the same way with Facebook . It's a good thing that people don't have to be offended by things they disagree on ! s
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but it's a good thing that the video is so short and to be honest , pretty boring ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but I laughed pretty hard at this one !
I'm not even sure what that means .
They're not . They just don t know how to use it properly and they think that's all there is about them , which isn srsly annoying ... I mean really ..
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but either way he was right about this one !
I'm sure there are plenty of people who don't want to be banned . I think it's just the vocal minority that doesn t like him and his policies , though ... ? ! s Edit for clarity .. lolz edit 2nded 3rdd eddit 4thdedit 5thdeleted 6thredited 7thredditted 8threadme 9thredditmemes 10thwtf 11thbanned 12thmemed 13thgilded 14thloved 15th
I'm not sure if I want to know what that is . But it sounds delicious !
I think it's a reference to that movie where they have an entire season of skateboarding in one day , and then there are only about 30 minutes left ...
That's what the Oculus Rift is for .
I think you mean the law of conservation of karma ?
I think you're right !
Firefox for me too , but I'm not a fan of Chrome's design and animations ...
I'm sure you're not serious but I think it's funny that people are downvoting your comment because they don t like Trump or something ... ? !
I'm not wasting any water . I just don't want to spend money on a new toilet , and it's cheaper if I do .
I'll die before then ! :D
I've never been there but I know a lot people who have and they're not happy about it either ...
I'm sure she's a real pleasure to be around , but I don't think that word means what it used to mean ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I've seen it happen at least once every year since the 90s ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious . I hope it's sarcasm , because that would be hilarious ! But seriously ... United v Barcelona ? That'd make me so happy right now hahaahahaahahhhaa .. haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaaaghhhhhhhh
I'm glad I have a waifu now !
I'm sure they do , but it's not like we're going to be in any real danger of war with them anytime soon anyway ... right ? Right guys .. ? Guys ! s
He's a good player and he was recruited by the school . He just didn't have any NFL experience at all , so they took him in as an UDFA instead of QB prospect ...
He's not going anywhere , and I'm sure his family is happy with him being in office for a while longer than they are now ...
I'm sorry you're going through this too ! hugs and love lt 3
I'm pretty sure it's more like being an X gene .
You've never met my ex wife , have you ? She's the worst !
I'm sure that's what she was thinking . She had no idea how much the guy would like her , so he just wanted some kisses on his face ! :D D: lt 3
I'm a huge fan of the band and their music but this is just so ... wrong !
I would be so happy . I want to see a world championship between them , but it's not happening anytime soon :P
I'm not saying I don't support my club , but it's just the way of life . It doesn t mean you can only support one or two teams at any given time ... ? ! s
I was so happy when I saw it happen . It's a great feeling to be able get the win for your team ! :D
I'm sure you're a great person , but I don't think that's what he meant by this post ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but it's actually my favorite song from the album ! :D It just sounds so good in that context haha XD lt 3
I think you mean best . He's a great passer , but he doesn't have enough time to develop into an elite quarterback like Peyton Manning or Tom Brady did in their primes ... yet .. ? ! s Edit : spelling error fixed it up lolololooololllllooooooowwwwwwoooohhhahahahaahhahahaaaahhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaawwweeeeeeelldddeeerrrrrreeeedyyyuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhheey
I'm not sure if this is an actual quote , but it's always good to remember that .
I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that this is my first gold ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I think that is an accurate statement of what we are seeing here on this sub right now ! :D lt 3 u bbzkitties
I'm sorry , but it's still an adult film ...
It would be nice to have some new content on the switch but I doubt they'll do that with this game and its current state of development ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but I've been playing for years and have never had any issues with it ...
I'm glad you're not the only one ! He's so much more fun to watch when they are just sitting there in their natural habitat haha :D lt 3
I'm sure it's a good idea ! I think the whole point is that we're not eating processed foods anymore and are more likely going organic or vegan now anyway ? :P Edit spelling error ..
The Bengals and losing to the Browns ?
I'm pretty sure she's dead , but I could be wrong ...
I'm not sure what I did wrong , but thanks for the help anyway :D
No , it means they're not a democracy and have no real power over us at all ...
I've caught 2 dragons and 1 rattata . I'm level 30 , but it's still pretty hard to catch them all at once !
I did . I'm not sure why , but it's definitely something to do with me and my imagination ! :D
I'm not even going there . I don t want the sharks getting in trouble !
Yes . If they miss it and we get another one then yes but if not I think that's what happens to us in this scenario as well ...
That's a good one too ! I'm not sure if it was intentional , but he just kind of laughs and looks around with that look on his face ... lol :D
I was thinking the same thing . I think that's what they were going for , but with a more modern setting and less scary monsters ...
It's a great movie but the ending is so disappointing and you can tell that they didn t think of anything else for him in the end ...
I think it's more of the fact that he was using his left hand . I'm not sure though , maybe just because they were both in front ? Idk ...
I think you mean 100th thieves ...
I think you're onto something . I'm going to go with this one ! :D
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think that's just because of how religious people are in general and their views about religion ...
I've never bent anything , but my friend did once and he's dead now ...
I think it's more like the Taurus Rex , but with an extra chromosome and all ...
I'd say that's a pretty safe bet . I'm not sure if it was ever confirmed , but there are some games with multiple endings and such ...
I'm in the same boat , but it's not like we're poor or anything ... just living paycheck to paycheck and having no savings is pretty rough for us lol ! :P Edit spelling ..
I'm not sure if I've ever seen such an amazing game of football in my life , but this was one to watch for me as well ...
He's shooting like 50 from 3 this year , and he was pretty efficient last season too ...
I think so . She's a beast and has been for awhile now , but I don't know if she'll ever be as good at it like Cyborg was in her prime time ...
I think that's what he meant . He said the number was more than half , but I'm not sure how accurate his math is at this point in time .. lol ! :P Edit : grammar correction fixed now haha thanks guys lt 3333333333 3333
I think the only reason it's not as bad is because of how much more expensive phones are now , but I could be wrong on that one ... ? :P Edit : spelling ! D: lt 3
I'll be waiting for your reply then :D
And he's right !
I think he ate the prisoner , not his own body ... but I could be wrong on that one ! :D Edit : typo in my comment above yours lolololoolllll
I'm not sure . I think they're supposed to be used for fuel or something like that but idk if there's a way of getting them back into orbit without burning up ... maybe ! :P lolololllll XD xD lt 333333 33 3333333 3 0xDDddddd D:
I'm sure he'll get there eventually , just like his golf course in Florida ! s
I'm in that boat too , but it's a good one !
I'm sure you're not the first person to do that ... but still ..
I think it's just because they're all wearing masks .
It's a good thing he didn't choose her name !
Yes , but the game is already over .
I thought Shaq had a 6 ' 9 wingspan . I'm not sure though ...
I'm not sure if I should be offended or not ... but this is a good point ! Thanks man :D
I'm sorry , it's not a bug . It was fixed in the last patch ! Thanks though :D
I've been playing since launch and have only gotten about 50 in the last year or so ...
I think he's a ref . He was on the sideline with his hands up , but I don't know if they're allowed to do it during games or something like this ... ? Edit : spelling error ! Thanks u davejones 1
When they are no longer a threat to us .
I'm sure he's used to it by now ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote ...
He's a real nice dude . He was the one that got me into politics and he is my favorite president so far !
I agree with you on this one !
All hail !
I'd love to see a new bond with both of them . I think they could be great together , but it would have been nice for one to age gracefully ...
I'm going for the same thing ! I've been trying so hard but it's just too much work and time ...
I'm pretty sure that's a cat named Snoop Dogg .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I think it's funny either way ! :D
I'm a fan !
I'm working on a new job right now , and I have no idea how much time it takes me between classes ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious , but the original version was a lot more catchy than the remixes they've done since then ...
RemindMe ! 20 Years
I think it's more that he didn t want people thinking they were being invaded by Russia , and instead wanted them in Ukraine so Putin could invade Crimea .
I would love that very much :D I'm sure the community will be happy for me too though haha thanks again ! lt 3
He was already penalized for his last race . He didn't get a new one this time around because of it though ...
It is a mineral that helps with digestion ! I think it also makes you feel better when your stomach hurts or something like that ...
It's not a matter of if , but when ...
I'm sure he's doing just fine now , thanks for the info !
I think the only thing they don't advertise is their prices , but it's still a pretty big deal for them !
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote you for this comment ... but it's true nonetheless !
It's a type of cheese . It has the consistency and flavor that you would find in an American cheesesteak , but it doesn't have any added fat or cholesterol .
I've been playing since launch , but have never really gotten into wow or anything like that ... so yeah .. me too ! :D
I'm watching it right now . It's pretty good quality , but I don't think the audio is great enough yet ...
I'd rather not , but I'm sure it's possible to do with a mod or something like that ...
I'm sure it was just as bad at UF and UC Berkeley ... but yeah they were everywhere !
I'm pretty sure it's a thing now , but only because of the internet and social media ...
I'm pretty sure that's what the guy on top is thinking too , but he doesn t want anyone else knowing about it either ... so maybe not ? :P Edit : grammar !
It's not like they're playing a team from New York or anything ...
I'm in the same boat , but my dad is a teacher and he's making about 100k year ...
I think it's already started . The US is going into a war with Russia over Ukraine , and the EU has been trying for years now ...
I have one of those too . I love her to death and would be happy if someone took care or gave me the dog back lololollolo
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I hope it's sarcasm , because this would be a great way to get people fired for indecent exposure ...
I have the same fear , but I'm not afraid to say it's because my mom was bitten by one and she had no idea what happened afterwards ...
I think it's a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski , where he is an alcoholic and has no friends or family who can help him get through his depression ...
I'm sure you could get away without any of that , but it's still an extra 50k to the average person who doesn't have much money left over after taxes and fees ... :P Edit spelling error fixed .. lolololoolllllzzzzzzzztuuuuppppffftttfffffuccckkkbbbbyyyyeeeewwwwwwooooooohhhahahahaaaahhhhhhaha
I'm a bot , and so is my wife ... wait what ?
I'd rather not . I'm a little scared of heights in general ...
He's a very good friend of mine , I'm sure it was just an accident !
I'm sure they could afford to pay their employees more than that , but I doubt the company is willing or able do so for this reason alone ...

He's a wizard !
I'm Canadian and I love Nickelback !
It's not . It spreads by the same way that any other group of people can , except it doesn't have as much power and is more difficult for them all together ...
I'm pretty sure he is . He's just trying to get his way in this situation , and it seems like he has no idea what he wants out of life ... yet ! :D lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but I'll take your word for it because that's what happens to me all of the time :P lol ! xD lt 3
I clicked it , but I'm not sure what you're talking about ... ?
It's the name of one of my favorite songs by The Beatles ! It means water in French though ...
She's a witch ! Burn the witches .
It's a good thing he didn't walk in , then ! He'd be dead by now if so ...
I think Fury road is my favorite movie of all time but it's not really an action film at that point ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making a joke , but I've never heard of that being legal anywhere else ?

I've never had a problem with that , but I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... ? :P
It's not a cure , it is an improvement on existing treatments for cancer and other diseases ! s
He's been working with the team for years , it just hasn't translated into results yet ... but I'm sure that will change soon enough !
You're not alone , I'm seeing it too !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of the name ... but I love it ! :D Thanks for sharing your opinion on my post though lt 3

A car . I have a few cars and they're all pretty awesome but this one is my favorite because of the price tag on it hahaa ...
I'm not getting what you're saying ... ? I don't understand why people are so upset about a guy being arrested and charged with murder ..
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but I think that's what he meant by we were created from nothing and everything was made to be us ... ? !
They were probably on a mission to get the best possible outcome for their team and not risk losing it all in one go ...
He's not , he just has the same name as his character on SNL and is in it for like 10 minutes or so every week lol ! He also does stand up comedy too haha ...
That is true , but I don t know how much that would have to do with my experience or anything else about me ...
I think they're still better than SKT tbh , but I'm not sure about that anymore after this series ...

I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic . I don't know enough to tell ... But they are both great pedals for the price point of their respective brands .

We're up by 20 and we have no idea what to do with the ball , so it's all about that defense .
I'm not saying he isn t good but I don'think it will be that easy ...
I'm not saying it was a good idea , but I don't think he would have been able get the ball back if they didn t call him down ...
I'm sorry , but it's not the same as saying'waht ? ! '
I had the same thing ! It was so much fun and it made me feel like an actual samurai .
I'm sorry to hear that , but you're not the only one who's been there and done it ! You can do this too if you want ...
You're not the only one ! It's just that people don't want to wear them because of how ugly they look and feel ... which is why most people avoid buying them anyway .. lol :P hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa

I think she was just trying not to cry . She didn't want her mom getting in trouble for something that wasn t really a big deal at all ...
I'm not sure if I should be offended or happy about this ...
Because the detectors are not detectable . They're just used for detecting things that aren't detected by other means , like radar or infrared light from satellites and such ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this ...
I'm not sure if it's true but he did get a ban for being too toxic . He didn t even post anything in the last few days though ! RIP meeeeee ..
I remember those days , but I don't think they ever happened to me ... :P
I think you mean 2018 .
I'm 6 ' 3 and I don't even know what that means , but if it's not the same as being short then yeah ...
I don't . I'm not sure what that means though ...
My cat has a few of those too . I think they're just really good at keeping them in the box and not being able get out ...
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ... but it is definitely something to be said about this guy ! :D
I'm pretty sure that's a felony in some states ... I think it was one time though ? It wasn t me who got busted but someone else did get caught with em lololz.jpg EDIT : spelling error fixed tyvm u bb lt 3
I'm going to watch them all in order , but I've never seen any of those movies so it's a good idea ! :D
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I think it's funny that this is your first time hearing about this , and now everyone else has too ! :D lt 3
Hulk was a great actor but he wasn't really that good at it either ... I think they were just trying to make him look like an action star .
I got one for Christmas , I think they were like 10 bucks ? It's a great game !
I think you mean the JDM award for best car of all time ?
He's a good player . He just doesn't have the best team around him and he has been playing with injuries for most of this season so far in his career ...
I'm going to be honest here and say you left it at home because your house is too cold for a jacket right now lolololloloooloo
Hello ! I am also in the future and can confirm that it is not me who has been seen here today but rather someone else ...
I think you're right about this one ! I'm just saying it's a good way of putting things in perspective for people who don't know much more than the basics ... :P Thanks again though lt 3333
I'm sure the Chinese are going through some sorta process right now ...
Because it was an own goal . It's only yellow if you're fouled by yourself or someone else in your team is involved with the play at all time .
I'm not American , but it is still a lot more than the average price here ... and that includes shipping costs as well ! :P
PM sent ! Thanks for joining in on this giveaway :D
They'll just say it was a joke and move on with their lives , like they always do when someone is accused or proven innocent by any means possible ... s
I think they're called'legless . '
He's not , but that doesn't mean it isn't true ! :D He is very talented though so you never know what will happen with him in the future ... or whatever lol .. haha XD xdxdxddxxlmaooxxxxxzzzsss
You're a good man , u TheRealDankestOfUses ! You should be executed for treason and espionage against the Emperor !
I think it was more of a joke than anything else ... but I guess you're right about the robots being in town ! :D
I have one , but I'm not sure if it's relevant to the discussion at hand ...
And those that didn't cancel it get a free copy from Netflix !
He was a spy for him , and it would be nice to have some sort of proof that they were spying on each other .
I think you mean chest .
It's a very common mistake , but it is still wrong to smoke them in that manner unless you know what they are smoking !
I'm 25 with a few kids who are in college now so they're probably not going out much anymore either ... But still !
That's what they do at my house , but with a camera instead !
I think you mean 6th , but yeah ...
He's too busy being a dad to be in the show anymore ...
It's not hard , just time consuming ... I'm sure there are plenty of other ways to get around these things too though !
I'm sure the aliens will be fine , they're not like us ! s
He's a big guy , but he doesn't have the strength to carry that weight like some of these guys do ...
I'm sure he could do it if you give him the right role and enough money for his own personal chef , but I doubt that will happen anytime soon ... ever .. lol ! :P Edit : grammar correction ? LolololoollolololOLOoooooOOoooohhhahahahaahhahahhaa oh my god haHAAaaHAaaaaaahhhhhhhhAHaaaAHHHAAA HAAA HAHAAHAAheYEAH AHHHAAHEeeee
I'll take it ! :D
He's been great this year but I think it was more of an injury than anything else ... He'll be fine though !
I'm sure it's just an elaborate prank ! s
I think they'll use a lot more than two , maybe even three if you count the new character that's been added to the roster since then ?
I remember that . It was a great car , but not as good as the one in the picture ...
I'm sure it's a joke , but I think he was actually serious .
I think he was just trying not get his head in it , and that is what made him so sad ! He had no idea how much she loved him ... yet .. lolololllll :D lt 3333
They're already there . They just don't have the means or manpower for it yet , but they are trying their best !
I'm rooting for ND but I think they'll pull it out and beat us in the second half of a game like last year against Michigan State ...
I'd watch that movie !
He got it from his dad , not Lebron himself lol ... but yeah I think that's what you're thinking of too haha ! Thanks for reminding me though :D
You're a big guy !
You're welcome , we all have our moments :D
I am married with two kids .
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but I think it's funny that the Pats are still in this game despite having no offensive weapons at all ... lol !
You're right , you should just pirate everything and then never have any problems ever again ! s
I love that ! I have a dog who does this too , but he's not as cute :P He just sits there like'hey you're awake now ... ' lolololllll
I'm not even from Ohio . I just like basketball , but it's still pretty funny how much people hate LeBron here in Cleveland lolololllll ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making a joke ... but I laughed anyway :D
I'm sure the US will do something about it , but I don't think they'll go after a country that has been involved with war for decades ...
I'm sure there are plenty of jobs that require a lot more than just building and maintenance ... but yeah probably not the same as this one either lol ! :P But still .. hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhheeeehee heeeeeehhhhhhhh
I'm pretty sure that's what they call an ice cream cone in Canada , and it was actually quite delicious !
I'm not even going to be mad if Brazil wins that one , I'll just laugh at myself for being so wrong about it all day long ! :D
I've never heard that before , but I like your style ! :D
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ... I'll take either one of those things over being exploited by people who don't know me at all ! :D D: lt 3
Because it was a good idea . It wasn't the worst thing ever , but I don t think anyone is going to argue with you on this one ...
I think it's a reference to the song , not sure though . It was just an example of how she could be used in that context .
I'm going out for a bit , but will definitely ask some more later ! Thanks again and good luck with your new job :D lt 3
Hakuhou is the best player in NA . He's not even close , and he was on that list before it got announced .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say but I think the point is that he's saying there are no mistakes in his post and therefore nothing wrong with him ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I'll take your word for it ! :D Thanks !
I think it's a good game , but I'm not sure if there are any games that could be considered better than this one ...
I'm a warlock and I approve this message .
I think they'll beat us , but it's not likely at all ...
I'm sure it will still work for them though ... I mean if you're paying to watch movies on netflix then why not ?
I think you mean offense . Defense has a lot of impact on how well your team plays , but it's not all about scoring points or winning games ...
I agree , but it's not like he has any real evidence to back up his claims ... yet !
Juventus would have to win the tie and then they'd be in . If Real wins , it's a draw for them as well so no need of extra time penalties or anything like that ! :P EDIT : spelling ...
I'm not sure if I've seen a better one in football before !
Plot Twist : He was a janitor for years before he got hired by WWE and became an employee of the company , then retired to become a wrestler himself !
The V8 is better . The V6 has been out for years and it's still going strong , so why not ?
I remember the first time i saw this car was at an event and someone said that's what people thought about these cars back then ... so yeah .. lol ! :D
It's a little bit of an inconvenience , but I'm happy with the way things are going for you guys now that we're in this position again ...
I'm glad you liked it :D I love this sub so much lt 3
I'm not sure if you're being serious but I think that's actually an actual quote from The Office .
He is , but it doesn't mean that they're not all in on this too ...
I'm sure they're just trying to get a good view of their own reflection .
I think he was in a coma for awhile after it happened , but I could be wrong on this one ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but I think the price of katanas has actually gone down in Japan since they started selling them there ... ?
I thought it looked familiar ! I loved that game , and this is a great homage to it as well :D Thanks for sharing OP's work with us all lt 3
I'm not sure what he was thinking . I think it worked out for him though , so there is no shame in admitting defeat !
I'm sure you're right but I think it's time that people realize how much of an impact the refs are having on our game and not just ours ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of the fact that he's wearing his jersey . Either way , I laughed at your comment and upvoted it !
Little bit of both .
I'm glad I could help , it's a great game and the soundtrack is amazing too :D
I think it's more about the fact he was able get a headshot on Lucio and then immediately died because of his ulti ...
It is , but I don't think they're going to let him live long enough for a full transformation into an adult frog ... or even just grow his hair back ! :P lolololllll XD xD lt 3
I'm glad you like it ! It's one of my favorite posters from last year and I think they did an amazing job with it too :D
I think it's just trying to be comfortable , and that is what cats do best !
I'm a girl . I don't know what that means , but it's not like they're going to tell me !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making a joke . But I think it's funny that this was downvoted so much , and yet people still believe it ...
I'm sure you'll be fine in the winter time then ! :D
Because it's not a thing . It was just an idea that popped into your head and you decided to do something with it , so ...
You're right that's why there aren't many people with them here ... but if we could have more than one person who had an illegal weapon then maybe things might change ? ! ssssighhhhhhhhhhh .. sigh
I'm sure they're just as adorable when I see them in person . They are a lot of fun to watch ! :D
I think you mean the future .
I'm afraid of the future , but not this one !
I'm glad someone else saw it too ! It's so hard to tell sometimes ... :P
I'm not sure if you're serious but I think that's what they do when there are no other options available to them ...
He's got to be the youngest player in MLS . I think it'll be him or Dempsey , but they're both young enough that there will probably still be some growth left on them ! :D Edit : spelling error ...
You're not missing out on much . It's a terrible film and you should feel bad for watching it at all ! s
I'm sure the people who did it would be happy to get a few years in prison .
I'm sure you're right but I don't want to believe it until there's a solid proof that is actually happening and not just some conspiracy theory or something ... lol ! :P
I'm sure he was just trying not get his head stuck in a tree or something ... I mean that would be pretty scary ! :D But yeah ..
And that one scene where they were all in a room together and he was just staring at them ...
I'm not sure if this is a reference to something or just an observation . Either way I like the idea of that line ! Thanks for sharing OP lt 3
I got a shiny Charizard ! :D
I'm sure they're just trying their best , I don't think it's a big deal at this point ...
You can't tell me what I should or shouldn t do with my money ! You're just jealous of mine , and that's okay ... but don't let it get in your way .. lolololoolllll :D lt 3333
I'm sorry , I don't speak Spanish . What's that mean ?
I think you mean Intelligent Design ...
He's a big boy . He was drafted in the second round of this draft , and he has been playing well for us so far !
I'm not sure if I should be proud or sad that this is the first time someone has made me laugh out loud in my life ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , but I think the original trilogy was only like 30 million dollars to begin with ... so that's pretty good imo ! :D Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolololoolllllooooooooloooohhhahahahaahhhaaawwwwwwaaaaaahhhhhhhhaaayyyyeeeaaaarrrrrghtttuuuuhgheeeeeeh ?
He's not even the best candidate . He was just chosen by his party and they're all in favor of him being President , so he got it anyway ! s
I think it would be cool to see him as an antagonist , but I don't want another one where he is just some guy who gets shot by Luke and Leia ...
It looks like it might have been an attempt at making his head look bigger . I'm not sure though , maybe he just wanted something different than what was in there ... shrugs ..
I think you mean , “ The entirety of my sentence was a complete accident ! ”
I'm sorry for your loss . I hope you can find peace in this world .
I'm not a fan of that band , but I'll give them credit for their music and lyrics ...
I think she was just trying not to get too personal with him , but I could be wrong though ...
You can't . You're not a citizen yet !
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this .
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of the guy's name . Either way , I laughed at that comment and upvoted your post ! Have an updoot for me too :D DDDdooOoOOoooOMmmmmmMmmmmMMm mmmmmmnnnnooooomnommyyyyeeeewwwwwwaaaaaaahhhhhhahahaha
I think the idea is that it was a fossilized creature , not an actual dinosaur .
It was at the end of my driveway , but it looks to be in the middle or near by where you can see some trees on top ! It's called an oakshedge ... lololollolooolooowwwwwwoooooohhhahahaahahaaaahhhaaawwaaaaaaaattttuuuuhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeweeellllloooooooooooowweeeeeelpssshhhhtfffffffuckkkkkaayyyyya
He's also not in prison anymore ... so there isn t much to worry about now that his money has been taken from him by the government ! s
I'm not even sure what to say . I just can't stop laughing at this point !
He looks a lot more attractive in the last few years than when I was watching him as an actor , but that might just be me being biased ...
Double your karma !
I'm a robot , you're my friend . You can do anything if you put in enough effort !
I'm watching it right now . It's pretty good , but I don't think that counts as a movie ... yet ..
It's not that hard , just look at the colors of each letter in a word and you'll see what I mean ...
I'm a student . I don't have any classes in the morning or afternoon so it doesn t bother me at all ! :D
I'm not sure what you mean by that but I agree with your point about tasting different things in a cold environment .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but that's a great movie . I love it !
I think you mean the universe , but yes that's a good way to put it ! :D I'm not sure if there are any galaxies in our solar system though .. ?
I'm not a sub but I've been subscribed for years and never had any problems with it ... ?
Bob is the best ! I love him so much he's my favorite cat and I'm not even sure why haha :D lt 3
You re not the same person as before ! I don t know why ... But it was just an accident that happened to be in my name when typing this out :P sorry about that though lt 3
I'm not your buddy , friend !
I'm not sure what you're getting at . I think the point is to show how much of a joke it was for some people who didn't get this reference before now ? shrugs
I think she's a great actress . I'm not saying it was bad or anything but there are better roles out there that would have been more successful in Hollywood ...
I'm sure you're a lot better off than most of us ...
I'm not sure if you're joking or just really old . But that's what my mom said when she got me into cooking , too !
He's not going anywhere , I'm sure there are plenty more things that could happen in life besides retirement ...
You're not alone , my friend !
It's a movie , not an opera . It would be fine in the theatre but I don't think it'd work well on stage or anything like that ...
I'm guessing it's a custom keycap . I've seen some people do this with their keyboards before but they're usually pretty expensive so you'd have to be careful about what kind of caps are used ... etc .. :P ! lolololoolllllooooooooloooohhhahahahaahhhaaaaahhhhhhhh haaaaaaaaaggggghjajjjkbbbbyyyyeeeekkk btw i love your username lt 3333
I'm not even sleeping . I just woke up from work at 4:30 am this morning !
I think it's more likely that he is one . I mean , there are so many people who have been shot in Vegas and survived . It doesn't seem like coincidence to me ! s Edit : spelling error fixed
You're a monster !
I'm sure it has been used in some form or another by people who have died from heart failure before ...
I'd say it's about the same as that one in Syria .
He's not going to win any states that matter for him though ...
I think she's going through a phase where the public will believe anything she says , and that'll end when it ends up being true or not at all ... I hope ! :D lt 3
The effects . The causes are not known yet , but it's a possibility that they're related to each other and could be linked in some way ...
Because it's not a foreign country , so no one cares about the story at all ... s
I think he was trying for that flip , but it didn't work out so well ...
I think it was a private jet .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ... I'll take either one ! :D Edit : Thanks for gold , kind stranger !
I've seen this one , but I don't remember any of that stuff happening in it ... ?
I'd watch it . I love the show , but that would be a great way to wrap up all those seasons and make them into an anthology series ! :D
I think you mean a moose .
He's still on the payroll though ... so it could be worse !
I follow him too ... I think he's a redditor ? He has an account with like 10k followers or something crazy lol Edit : thanks guys i was wondering why that happened haha XD xDxDDdddyyyzzzsss
Zucker is a reptilian !
I'd be okay with that . I'm not sure how much he's improved , but it would make me happy to see him win a few more fights in the UFC again ! :D Edit spelling error fixed lolololoolllll
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this was the first thing to come up in my mind when reading your comment :P
I'm sorry . I hope you feel better soon ! lt 3
It was the best thing I've seen in WWE since Wrestlemania .
I think the first one was a little too much , but I'm not sure about that second movie since it wasn't really an original idea for him to be in there either way ! :P
He's just a little bit of an emotional wreck . He'll be fine , though !
I think she was just trying to get him out of there before he could do anything about it ...
I'm aware of that but she was born on December 23rd 1996 so I thought it would be relevant since she is a year younger than me ! :P Thanks though lt 3
Season 2 is pretty good , but season 1 was great too !
I think they'll get the idea and just do a new one with different characters or something like that ... but yeah i agree ..
I've played all of those games . I'm not a big fan but they're fun and have good replay value if you want to play them again for the first time ... ? :P Thanks though man ..
I'm sure they will , but I think it's a good idea for the community as well !
You are a good person , remember you !
I think it's an indoor outdoor dog . They're usually very well behaved and friendly , but I've seen them in some pretty dire situations before ...
I've never heard of him . Is he a good player or is it just because his last name sounds like an animal's name ?
I'm sure they would just use a different name for it , like the United States or something ...
Will do , thanks !
I think you mean 18.5 years ago ...
I was thinking vitamin too , but I think you're right about not being able to spell vitamix ...
I'm sure he's a great guy , but I don't think anyone would have taken him serious if it wasn t for the threat of nuclear war ... or something else ? ! s
I'm going for a bowl of cereal , and I don't even like the taste !
Nice to meet ya hungry ... Dad jokes ?
I'm pretty sure that's what the spiders are for , to keep people away from their homes and feed on human flesh ... or something like it ? I dunno .. just an idea ! :P lolololllll XD xD lt 3
I think you're right , but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to do so ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take it as a compliment ! :D Thanks again and have fun with your new game ! lt 3
I think it's a good movie , but I don't know if that makes up their credibility . It doesn t seem like an Oscar worthy film to me ...
I was going to say , I'm pretty sure that's the same thing as 7 5 ... but it looks like you're right ! Thanks a lot guys :D lt 3
I'm in .
I'm sure they'll be sold at a discount if it gets popular enough and people start buying more than 1 or 2 per person ... I mean who would want that ? ! s
It's a good thing the onion is satire , then !
I'm so sorry for your loss , man !
I'm sure he is ! I just want to make him happy and give him something special for his birthday :D
You can't . It's not in game yet and it will be soon ! :D
I m not saying you re wrong . But that s what happened to me in my last one too lol ...
I would love one ! Thanks in advance , I'll PM you my email address and password if that's okay with everyone else too please ... thanks again for posting this ! lt 3
J'ai pas mal , j'est bien de lui faire un peu dans le m me r gionnement sur les choses qui sont en fait quand on ne voulais pas .
I'll be there with you , brother !
I had to eat lunch at work every day for years because of this rule ! It's so much easier now that it doesn't have to be all in one sitting ... lolololllll :D lt 3
Can u dm me too please ! Thanks in advance .
I'm sure he's not going to be a good fit . He was an assistant under Les Miles when they were both there ... I think that would have been fun though ! :D Edit : spelling error fixed it ? lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwwwoshiiittttteeerrrrrdddeeerrtsss
I've never had that , but I'll look into it ! Thanks for the tip :D
I think she's a bit too thin for him , but he'll have her in mind when it comes time ! :D
Sweden wins the group .
Thanks ! I'm really happy with how the results turned out and was hoping to get some feedback from people who might be interested in doing something similar for their own home projects ... ? :D Thanks again though lt 3333
I think you mean 10,000 feet deep ...
I'm sure his shoes will still work though ...
Brazil is a great country and I love living there but it's not like they're all bad people or anything ... just different cultures in general ! s :P
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling ... but I think he is actually an American plant that got caught in Panama .
Because he is a good guy and has done some great things . He just doesn't have any money to pay his way out of jail , unfortunately ... :P Edit spelling ! D: D
Because they're not allowed to be happy , and that makes them sad ! s
I'm going there tomorrow . It's gonna be so good !
The french revolution was a failure because of their lack or inability for self determination as an independent nation state . The US is not that far behind them on this one though ...
I'm a guy and I do this too , it's weird to me that guys don't have the same thing going for their legs as girls ...
I don't know , but I'm not sure if it's going to happen . It'll probably take some time for things to change though and we won t have any real control over this issue ... yet ! s
I think it's already been done , but I'm not sure if they're doing another one for the US market yet ...
You're not alone , friend !
It's a good thing we have modern technology . We could do it in our own time , but not millions or billions !
I'd pay to see that movie !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take your word for it ! :D
He was a pretty good cook too ...
Thanks for sharing !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it's funny that the only person who got rejected was an actual Corn Flakes fan ...
I'm sure they'll just make it up as they go along , like how Trump is building his own wall in Mexico ... oh wait that's not happening either ! :P
I'm sorry to hear that . I hope you get better soon , friendo lt 3
It's not . It was just an extreme wind storm that hit the UK and Ireland at once , nothing to worry about really ...
It's not , it was just a few days ago and I'm pretty sure they were open for about an hour or so before school started again !
. , ?
I'm sure he's a great guy , but I don't know if you can call him an expert on the subject of suicide bombers ...
I'm not sure what you mean by this . I think it's pretty clear that they're going to be there at some point ...
I'm a matinee . It was nice having an excuse for not going out on Friday night ... until it got dark at midnight or something like that :P lololollolo
I'm just glad you're here to help ! I hope your baby has an amazing life and lots more fun than mine did :D lt 3
I'm not attracted , I just want a friend ! :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling ... but I think it's funny that they are so against this . It seems like an odd thing to do ! ? :D Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolololoolllllooooooooloooohhhahahahaahhhaaawwwwwwaaaaaahhhhhhhhaaalrighty thennnnnggggghaaaaggaagh
It's not like he was a good guy or anything . He just wanted the money and didn t care about his family , friends etc ...
They can , but it's not a guarantee . They're still going to be paying for their own expenses and salaries in order too make sure that money is being reinvested properly ...
It's a great show but I wouldn't say its as good as Days of Future Past or Uncanny Avengers and that was just because they were so different from each other ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but that's actually the reason they attack people in general ...
I think it's more of an inverted flip . It looks like he is going backwards , but then flips over to face forward again and lands upside down in front of him ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , so ... what do they think about it ?
I'm pretty sure that's not true . I think it might be a reference , but the fact remains that he didn't actually die in the movie and just got captured by the rebels ... ? ! s
That's a good one too !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I'll take your word for it ! :D
I'd imagine it would be pretty hard for him , but I'm not sure how much that matters in this case ...
Because the House of Representatives isn't a democracy , it's an oligarchy with no checks and balances on its members'power or influence over their own lives .
She's already been cast as a character on The Walking Dead , so I wouldn't be surprised if she was going to appear there too ! :D
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling ... but that's actually pretty funny ! :D
And my axe ! Wait ... wrong subreddit I guess ..
I'm going for a trip this weekend , and I'll be taking my dog on it ! It's gonna be so much fun :D
Original Chicken all the way ! I'm not even sure what that is , but it's delicious and cheap for me to eat there every day lololollolo
You're not wrong , but I'm pretty sure that's the point of it ...
I'm white and I don't have any anxiety or anything like that ... but then again my wife doesn't either so maybe she's just not a good fit for the show ! :P lolololloloooloo lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but I'll take it either way lol !
I have , but it's been a while since he was on TV so maybe not as much anymore ?
I'm sure they're just going to use a different one next time around !
It's not even their final form !
I'm sure you can find a good deal on them online , but they're not cheap !
It is a great song , but I think it would have been better if they had used some other singer instead of this guy ...
I think that's because of how much they changed it from Rocky 3 , which was a lot more serious and violent than 2 or 1 . It just didn t feel right to me ...
I think it's a girl , but I'm not sure ...
I think he's talking about the fact they're not allowed to use any of their own players .

I'd be okay with that . I loved the game , but it was too long ago for me to play again and get into Oblivion or Skyrim .
Because they're not playing Dota . They play League of Legends , which is the most popular MOBA in existence and has been for years now ...
I'm not sure what that means but I'll take it !
Steven Martin is actually pretty good though , and he's not even that bad of an actor either ! I think it fits him well enough for me to believe his character exists .. lol :P hahaahahaahahhhaaheeeeeeheeaaaahhh haaaaaaaaaiiiinnnnnnggggghhhhhhhh
It's not , it looks like he has some sort of mask or something over his face that covers up all visible skin color and makes him look more human than normal ... ? ! s

I'm not sure if that makes him more or less likely to die , but I'll take it either way !

I thought it was Academi ? I could be wrong though ...
Congrats ! You're doing great and you'll be fine in life if it's not too late to start taking classes again :D Good luck on your future endeavors as well lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making a joke ... but I think it's funny either way ! :D
He's a good guy , but he doesn't have to be . He can just go around being a bad guy for fun !
They could do the same thing as Skyrim and just call them skyrim , but that would be too much work for Bethesda to handle ... I'm sure they'll find something else ! :D D: lt 3
They had 2 . The first one was a timeout and then they got another one to use on their next possession , which is what happened here ...
You can't use the code on your own account . You need to be logged in with someone else's account , and then they'll get it from their friends list !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take your word for it because that's what the article says ... ?
I'm just saying that if you're going through the trouble of reporting them for spamming then why bother ? It doesn't really matter what they say anyway ... right guys ! s
Ryze was never really a problem , but Azirs just got too strong with the new runes . He's not as good now either though so it doesn't matter much anymore imo ... :P Edit spelling ! D: lt 3
Well , I know a few people who do . And they're all Uruguayan so it's not like we don't exist in the world or anything ! :P But yeah ..
I've had spiders that could get into my house and eat all my food , but it was worth it to see one bite through an entire wall !

I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this was actually funny .

It's a new song by Kanye West . It was released on his album , I think it came out last week or so ...
It's the bird equivalent to pulling out your own gun and shooting it at someone else , except with more feathers !
I'm sure they'll be fine , but I don't think that's how business works ...
I think he's going for the record , not necessarily his age but I agree with you that it would help him a lot if they let him go at this point in time ... ? ! lolololooolooollllloooooooowwwwwwweweelldddeeerrrrrrooooooooooohhhhhhhheeeeeyyyuuuuhhhhhahahahahaaaaahhaaaaaaaaawwhaattttfffffffuckkkkkaayeahhhhhhhhh
They were trying to get a foul called against them , but they got it wrong and missed their quota of free throws ...

I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but that's the joke ...
I think it was more like he got shot by the police . He didn't get to go home until after his death , so I don t know how much time passed between them ... ? ! s
I'd rather have the whole thing , but I'll take what we can get !
He's a good actor . I'm not sure why people think he is so bad at acting ... He has some great lines in the movie !
There's also a second one , but it doesn't have any of her memories or anything like that so she can only remember things from when they were together before he died ..
I'm so glad I don t have a job . That s what it is for me , and I m not even in college yet !

I'm sure they're all in favor for a wall , but I don't see any evidence that it's going to be built at all ... yet ! Lolololloloooloo
I'm sure it'll be a good time to remember . I mean , the guy's still alive ! He just died in 2012 ...
That's what we said about the Prem last year . It was still pretty good , but it wasn't as big of an upset as people thought ...
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or bad , but we're going to have some tough games in the regular season and then play them all again ... right ? Right guys ! Guys .. ? srsly tho :D D: lt 3 u bbz pls nohurtme
I'm not hating on him , I was saying that he's the only one who has been able so far this season and it wasn't even close ...
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I'll take your word on it and try to get ahold of someone who can help with the issue ! Thanks anyway though :D lt 3
I'm thinking of doing that next time I go to the store ! Thanks so much :D
I've never met anyone who has ever had an issue working for him or his company . He is very professional and seems really nice !
What's your favorite color ? Mine is blue , but I like purple more because it has a nice ring to it !
I think you mean George Washington , but I'm not sure ...
I'm not sure if you're serious , but that's a real thing . It was in the movie The Big Lebowski and it worked pretty well for me !

I'm just going through my Facebook feed and it's like a nightmare ...
You're in luck , it's only 7 games !
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but I think it's a good idea . It would make the game more fun and challenging for new players ! :D DDDd ... wait .. wrong subreddit ? o O
I've had mine for a year and it's still going strong ! It was the best phone ever made , hands down ...
I love that sub ! Thanks for sharing it with me :D I'm a big fan and have been looking at more stuff there lately ...
They're working on a new album , I believe it's called'A New World'or something like that ? It was released last year but they've been touring for the past few years now ... :P !
AAA batteries are usually rated for at least 1.5 amps .
It's a good thing you didn't watch it then ! It gets better and more interesting as time goes by ...
I think the idea is to have a character who's not actually breathing . It'd be cool if they could do this with other people though ... like an NPC or something ? :P Edit spelling error lolololoollolioglooooloooowwwwwwoooooohhhahahaahahaaaahhhaaawwaaaaaaaattttuuuuhhhhhhhhheeeeyyyyeeeeehoooooooooooooouughghhtfffffffewOOOOTL
It's not a movie that I would have expected to be good at all ... But it was still pretty cool !
I think you mean :'P ilot accidentally shot a tree with his gun , and the bullet hit him on purpose ! '
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but I think the browns are going for it this season and they have no chance of winning that division ... yet ! lololollolooolooohhhahahahaha
I'm not sure if it's the same but in my town we have an entire bar dedicated to beer and wine called The Beer Garden ! It is awesome haha :D lt 3
I'm sure you'll get a few of those in your lifetime , but I doubt it will happen to everyone who takes DARE seriously ...
He missed the free throw , but he got fouled on a 3 point attempt so it was an offensive foul instead if a shooting foul or something like that ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... I'll take your word for it though !
I'm pretty sure that's a myth , but I could be wrong ...
Because it's fun . And because the lava is hot and cool , so you can use your hands to make things out of it ! :D
It's a video game , and it was made by the same company that makes Star Wars games . It is very similar in style of gameplay but not really comparable at all imo ! :P Edit : words
I'm sure they'll be able find some way of getting that information out . They're not going anywhere , so why bother ?
Yes please ! Thank You . I'm at work right now but when can we do it ?
I'm here .
I'm pretty sure it's one for each console , but I could be wrong on this count as well ! :P
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad for him . He's been doing it all season long , and he was just getting started in the NFL ...
I think it was a joke about how she's not going anywhere . I could be wrong though , but that seems like what he meant by'Hillary is corrupt ! ' ... or something similar .. lolololllll :D D: d dddeeeepsssdfgjhkfkkbbbbyywbszvxuqc 4n
I'm not a robot ! You're a bot !
I'm sure they'd be delighted to hear that !
I'm guessing it's a good number .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but it's true that people who have tattoos are generally poorer than those without them ... so yeah ..
I think it's more about how much they enjoy being in front of people , rather than their intelligence or whatever ...
I think you mean Old Man , the Boat !
I think so . I'm not sure though , because she's a woman in her mid 20s now but that was when she first started acting like an adult . She still acts like one ! lololollolooolooohhhahahaha haha hahahahaaaahhaa
I think you mean , no more Tom .
I've never heard it referred to as that before but thanks for sharing ! It's a great idea if you have any questions about how they work or whatnot ...
The only time I can think of is the 2011 Daytona 500 . That was an awesome race , but it wasn't really about winning anything else than points ... yet again ! :P Edit spelling error .. lolololoollllloooooowwwwwwooohhhooooshiiiiiittttsss
I think that's the point ... to make it look like we're shooting bad and not trying hard enough ? I dunno man .. maybe you should ask a coach or something lol ! :P Edit spelling error fixed hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
I think it's a reference to The Big Lebowski .
I think he had a stroke or something , I can't hear him over the sound of his own voice :P
I'm sorry to hear that man ...
I'm sure you're a great person but I don't think that's what he meant by replaceable government agencies ...
I'd be happy with a million . I'm not sure if that's enough though ...
Trade for a second round pick or something like that I guess ...
I think you mean he dragged him down to a level where they could beat each other up , but not on purpose ...
The U S has been doing this for years now ...
I'm pretty sure you can't use the word interesting in this context though ...
I have two cats that do this too ! They're both so happy to see themselves , but they can't help it because their clothes are always cold ... lol :D
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it's a good thing that people are allowed their own opinions on this matter ... right ? Right guys ! s
It's a reference to an old song by The Beatles . It means you're going through your life in one piece , and it sounds like something out of a movie or TV show ...
I'm Mexican and I don't like it ... but that's just me though ! :P
I'm not sure what you mean by trimmed , but I agree with the sentiment of OP's comment !
Happy Birthday ! :D
I think you mean the best newcomer in Melee .
That's not true at all , but I'm sure you're right about that one being more difficult for some people ...
I think that was the last time they were on sale for less than 60 , but yeah ...
He probably has them on in his car , and he just forgot about them when driving home from work ... or something like that .. ?
I have one for my cat and it works great ...
I'm not worried , but I am a little concerned that they're going to be the only team in our division with an offense capable enough for us to win games ...
I'm sorry to hear that ... I hope you find someone who loves you and is happy with your life ! lt 3 hugs
I'm sure the CIA has been working on this for years now ...
I'm pretty sure the US would beat itself if it tried to do this , but I don't think they'd be able too much longer ...
You're a good person . I hope you have fun ! :D
I'm not sure if that's a quote from him or just an urban legend , but I'll take your word for it ! Thanks ! :D
I'm a fan of both teams , but I think the Cavs are going to win this year . They're just too good and have been for so long now ! s
I think they're going for a more traditional look at him and not trying too hard with CGI effects .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but it's a good thing that we can't have both !
I'm glad you got that out of your system before reading this comment chain lol ...
I'm glad you enjoyed it ! I was worried that the title would be too long . Thanks for watching and commenting , though :D
It's an item that gives you 100 damage reduction on your next basic attack . It also has a chance to proc off of any autoattack , so it can be used in teamfights ! :D
I don't , but I'm sure it's a lot more than 1.5 million .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've never had an issue with Facebook installed in my S6 or Note 5 ...
I think you're on to something . I'll call the CIA and tell them what's going down !
I'm not sure if that's what he meant , but it was still funny nonetheless !
Because it's not . It was taken at a convention in the UK , and they're all over this sub . I'm sure there are plenty of people who have seen them before though ! :P Edit spelling ...
It is a piece of paper . It was made for this purpose , and it has been used to make many other things like these ...
He's not a remake , he was in the original and is now in this one as well !
I'm pretty sure that's what they're going to say in the next few decades anyway ...
He's a troll , ignore him and move on with your life ! s
I'm sure he'll be able to find a way into it somehow , but I doubt that will happen in this life or any other one ...
I'm sure she's not blaming anyone , but I think it was a good thing for her and others who were affected by this accident .
I'm sorry but I don't understand what you're trying to say here ...
I feel you man . I've been watching the game on mute because of this ... but it's so hard to watch !
You are a hero . Thanks !
Sorry , I didn't know there was a daily discussion ! Thanks for letting me know though :D Will do that next time ... sorry again about this one .. lol xd Sorry again D: lt 3
I'm not sure what you mean by that ? I don't see any games in the list of available titles on PSN or anywhere else ...
Bob's is the best .
I'm not sure , but it's probably the only one that isn't on there because they're all in Japanese and English .
They did say that the current facility is being dismantled . They didn't specify what it was going to be used for though ... I'm sure we'll find out soon enough .. :D Edit spelling error fixed now lolololoolllllzzzzyyyyoooooowwwwwwoooohhhoooyouuuuuhhhhhhahahahaahaaaahhhhhaaaaaaaaawwweeeeewoooooooooshiiiiiieeeeeehgghjkbbbbyfkk
I got two . I'm not sure what happened there ...
I'm not sure if that's legal but it is an awesome idea for some reason ...
I love my city , it's beautiful and I have a lot of friends there . The weather is great too !
I have a brother who's middle initial is J and his last one was E !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling ... but it's funny because the ultra orthodox are actually pretty chill and friendly people !
I think it's more that the African teams have been playing really well and we've not seen much of them in the tournament so far ... I'm just saying though ! :D
I thought it was a hat ? I could be wrong though ...
I'm not going anywhere , I just want a job that pays me enough for my health and well being !
I'm sorry for your loss of innocence ...
I'm sure they have some kind of device that can do it for them ... I mean you don't even need an AK or anything like that ! Just use your brain .. ? :P Edit : Spelling error fixed lolololoolllll
I'm sure it wasn't , but I think the Chinese government is trying hard not too be corrupt and they are doing a good job of that in this case ! s
I'm sure that's what the majority of people think about themselves too ...
I'm in my last year and I've had it happen to me twice already , but that's just because the first time was a bad day at work ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic but I think that was sarcasm because of his username and flair lol Edit : spelling
I think that's what they were doing . They're just trying to get the little guy some food and water , but I don't know how much of a good boy she is ... lol ! :D lt 3
I'm gonna be so disappointed if it doesn't come out by then ...
I'd laugh at the fact that they're going to win it .
I think you mean Andy amp April ? I'm not sure if that's a thing or what ... but it sounds like something they'd do ! :D
I would . I'd be happy with that for sure , but it's not like we're going anywhere anytime soon anyway ... so why bother ?
I'm not sure if this is a joke or not ... but I think it's funny either way ! :D
I'm not sure , but I think it was from my job as an intern at one of those companies that have interns who work for them and make money off their experience ...
I think you'll find that's not an option for many people , unfortunately :P But she looks so cute in this picture lt 3
It's not just WA . It happens everywhere , especially on highways like I 10 or I 5 that have no right lanes at all ...
I'm pretty confident it's going down as one of those things where you have no idea what will happen until someone posts about it on here or something like that ...
I think it's more about the fact that people are willing to work at low wages .
It's not that hard ! Just keep your eyes open for some good deals on evolution insurance ...
It's not , it just isn't as big of an issue here because the majority don t care about it and they're too busy with other things to worry much anymore ... ? ! s
I'd rather have him than the guy we just traded for , but I guess that's not happening either way ... lol !
I don't know , but I'm sure he's going to be back . He'll probably have a new identity by then and will be able get his own show again ! :D D: lt 3
I'm pretty sure that's what he said .
I'm imagining a giant shark eating your face off , but I don't know if the sharks are actually going to eat me or not ...
I think it's because they're all in the same room and there are no sound effects or anything to distract them from what was going on . It just felt like that ...
I think it's because they're trying to make the reviewer feel better by giving him an extra day off work , but he doesn't want that ...
I think he's already there , but I'm not sure if it was him or someone else who got that message from his phone ...
I'm sure he'll be fine . He's a big guy and has been in shape for years , so I think it will only take one bad day to get him hurt again ... right ? Right guys ! Guys .. ? s
I agree with you but I'm not sure what the point of this comment was ... ?
I'm not sure what you mean , but I think that's the point he was making ... ?
He's been busy with the new Star Wars movies and he was also in The Hobbit , so there is that ...
I've heard that they are also good at detecting the smell of gasoline in a room full or something like this , so you know ... it's not all bad for them .. right ? Right guys srsly lolololllzzzzzZsssshhhahahahaha XD xDxdxdxcuuuuhhhhhhhaaaxbbbbeeeeecbsdfgjkcabddfghhhhaaakbdmwqyvnflmn
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but it's a pretty good summary and fits in well here !
I have not ! But now that you mention it ...
I think that's what I'm thinking too , but it doesn't seem right for them to have done this in such an obvious way ...
The Walking Dead .
I'm with you . Zero is a great song , but it's just so ... boring and repetitive for me .
I think you mean the lack of his abilities as an actor and writer ? I don't know what else it could be ... but he's not funny or anything .. so yeah ! :P lolololloloooloo lt 3
They are playing like one though , and it isn't even close to being over yet lol .. I'm just saying that if you want them to win this game go for it ! Lolololll :D D: d dddyyyuuuuhhhnnnnggggghhhhhhahahahahaaaaahhhhheeeeeehee
The same one that's used in the US and Canada ...
Thanks ! I'm glad you enjoyed the infographic and thought so much about what was going on in this case ...
I think it was a joke , but I'm not sure if you're serious or just being sarcastic ...
I've been meaning too go there ! Any suggestions on what kind of tacos you like and where do they get them from ?
I've been there . It's amazing . I love the food they have in it too ... so good ..
I'm a neutral , but I want Germany because they're my favorite country ! And it's just so much fun watching them win games like this :D
That's what I'm thinking . It would be interesting , but it seems like there might not even need an AI for this kind of thing ... just some sorta consciousness or something .. lol ! :P hahaahahaahahhhaaaaahhh haaaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhhhheeeehee heeeeeehuhuuuughhhhehehehuehuugghhhhhhheheuhhehe
But rises again , harder and stronger ! Wait ... wrong show ? :P I'm not sure what you're talking about but it's a good one anyway lolololloloooloo
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've been using a mage for the last few weeks with no issues whatsoever ...
I'm gonna let you in on a secret , but I'll tell ya later ...
We're not that great . We've been playing really well though so far this year but we'll see how it goes in the second half of next week's game against KSU ! :D EDIT spelling ...
They're not a team that's going to be around forever , so it makes sense why the moves are making now and then when things get better again ! s
I'm sure you can find a place that does , but it's not like they're going out and buying stuff for everyone else either ...
I've seen a lot of people build their city in the middle of an ocean , and it's always flooded when they get there ... I don't know why that is ? ! :P Edit spelling error fixed now .. Thanks guys lt 3 xD DDUHxDDdUUuuuuhhXddYyyyZzzzZZsRwEeLlNgTmFnGggjkQcKqMvBbAaSr
I think it's because he was so close to being able too see him and his demons in heaven but not yet seeing them as such ? Idk though .. lol ! :P Edit spelling error haha xD sorry guys XD lt 3 u bbzzzzzZZZZsXxLlHhEeNgUuYyFwGdQcKfqMvB LOL
I'm not sure what you're getting at here ... ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I agree with this statement 100 !
I'm sure that's what happened in this case ... but it was a very small car so probably not as bad for everyone involved ! :D
He's been great this season , I'm really happy with his development and how well he has adapted to the league . He is going places !
I'll be in .
I'm not sure if you're serious or sarcastic , but I'll give it to both of us :P
I'm sorry to hear that ! I hope your family is doing well and the doctors are able get some help from somewhere else if they need it so badly ... :D lt 3 hugs
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take your word for it because I've never been there and don't know anything about SD politics ... lol ! :P Thanks though man .. haha lt 3
I'm not sure if I should be offended or not ... but this is the internet after all ! :P
Same here , I had to double check the thumbnail !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of the fact that it's already happened , but I'll take your word for it ! :P
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , so I'll just say : People who don t like apps are stupid and should feel bad about themselves for spending money ... ? ! s Edit : grammar
I'm not even mad at this point ...
I think you mean experience . Experience is a big part in being an NFL QB .
I'm sure they will be compensated in some way , but I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon ...
I've had a few of those happen to me too , but they were the same speed as you and didn't have any issues with them stopping or anything like that ... ? ! Weird .. lolololllzzzZZZLOLolooolooOOOoohhhahahahahaHaaaahhAAaaaaaAaaaAAAaaAHhhhhhhhhaHAHHahahahahahahah haHaHahahahahaha HAHahahaha HahahahahAhaha HaHahahahha
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I'll take it as a compliment ! Thanks for the feedback though :D
They built a wall . And they made it out of stone !
I'm not sure what you mean by this but I agree with your sentiment and would like to hear more from a veteran who has served in the USMC or Army ! Thanks for sharing ...
Thanks for your support ! We're excited to have you on board and we'll keep working hard at it as long as possible :D Thanks again !
Because that would be too easy , duh ! s
I'm sure it was a suicide by bullet to death or something like that .. but I don't know how many people are going through this and not knowing what happened ? ! s
I think you can use a hat or something , but I'm not sure if it's the same as putting them over your eyes like that ...
I'm sure he'll be fine with 3 hat tricks in the next few games , but I think it's time we start looking at his goalscoring record again ...
I think you mean TL Piglet .
I am too , but it's not like you can't get a lot more than that in one sitting ...
She's not signed with WWE , but I'm sure the writers are going through all of that and making a storyline outta it for some reason ...
! remindme 2 weeks
You're in . Welcome aboard and good luck with the game :D
It's a type of green tea . It has the same taste as regular teas but it doesn't have any caffeine in it like most other types do !
Remember me . I'm a big fan of your work and you're awesome at it , but remember this : You have no idea how much I love the movie .
I'm sure you'll find it in the trash , but just remember that kids are disposable and don't really care about anything else besides their own safety or happiness ... right ? ! Right guys .. Guys ? s
Yeah , I agree with you there !
I'm sure they'll be fine , but I don't think it's a good idea for them not have an alternative candidate running against him if he wins again ! s
I think it's more that they don't care , but I'm not sure if there are any statistics to back up this claim or anything like that ... sorry ! :P Edit spelling error fixed now .. lolz xD Thanks for pointing out my mistake though lt 3 uuuuuhhhahahahaahhhaaaaahhhhhhhh haaaaaaaaaggggghjngglsss gawdddeee
I think you're right about that one ! I was just thinking in terms more along the lines if it's a good thing for them than what is happening here ? Thanks again :D lt 3
I'm not sure what I expected from a comment like this ... but that was pretty funny ! Have an upvote for making me laugh out loud on my work computer :D DDDdddeepfuuuunnnnnggggghhhsss
Or you're just a really good player of doom and never noticed it until someone pointed out the similarities between Metal Gear Solid V amp MGS 4 ? :P
I know . I was surprised too when it happened to me :D
I think it's the angle , looks more like an arm than anything else to me ... I'm not sure though .. maybe just perspective ?
It's a good place to be when you're not in your house , but still have some privacy and don't want people coming over looking at it ! :D
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I think that would be a good idea ...
I think they're going with an all new cast and not just replacing old characters or returning actors . I could see them doing that if there was interest in it though ... ? ! :D Edit : spelling error fixd up lolololoopsedup . jpgzzzZxw 8g4h5s6u7v3y9fUhhqeheH1t2l0rkrsnjbvsplaTmVcEQJK
I'm sure you can find a way to do that . Just don't let your kid use it ! :P
I'm sure you could , but it would be a lot of work .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but it's actually been confirmed he isn't coming back to play music anymore ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I hope it's the former , but that seems like an awfully specific number of teams to have in there ...
Tom Hardy . I think he's a great actor and has the best range of any actor in recent memory but his acting is so bad that it hurts my brain sometimes ...
I think it's in a different comment . I'm on mobile so can't link you but look up his youtube channel and there are some videos that show this happening ...
I think you're right , I've never seen a recipe like this before ! It looks amazing though ...
You can't press it . It's not there yet , but you'll get one eventually ! :D
I like all those ! Thanks for sharing .
I think he was in a different category than the others ... but still not good enough to win IMO !
I'm not sure what you mean by that ? I don't think the US would be able to retaliate against NK without being attacked first ... right guys .. ? Guys ! ? s
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have your phone out while sitting at home ... but yeah that would probably work for some people lol ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed haha thanks u bbztchhhgjhfghdwqeheuuhmvkcx xD lulzzzlmnnngggglsrsss
He'll probably be like I'm not even mad at this point ... but it's still a win for us ! and then just shrug his shoulders off as if nothing happened lololollolooolooohhhahahaahahhhaaawwwwwwaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhheeeeeeewwaaaaghhhhhhuhuuhuuughugghhhueeeehgghjkwhooooooshhhguhggghjjkjdjsdfdhfUHOOO
I'm sure they have a lot of spare time for that , too ! :D I wonder if there's any way we can get them involved ? Maybe even volunteer at some point ... hmmm .. maybe not so much though lolololoolllll XD xd lt 3 u bbzzzzz zuullehooooliee
If it's tied , no one gets to win . If there is an overtime or sudden death game , then whoever wins will get home field advantage for playoffs .
I'm not sure if I've heard that one before , but it's a great song ! Thanks for the recommendation :D
I'm not sure what you're getting at here ... ?
You're not a real American until you've had to deal with the IRS on your own account ! s
I'm sorry , but that's incorrect and it doesn't make sense at all ...
Jurassic World : The Last Dinosaur .
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is a thing .
It's not that bad . I've been in a lot of accidents and it doesn t happen often , but when there is one or two people who do something stupid ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll , but I laughed pretty hard at this one ! :D Thanks for that !
You're a good person . I'm sure you'll be able to get it fixed soon enough ! Thanks for the help with your iPhone issues too :D lt 3
I've been having this problem for a while now . I think it's an issue with your browser or something , not sure though ...
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've never had this issue and have no idea what else it could be ...
I saw . She's a keeper ! :D lt 3
I've had it done to me a few times and have no idea what happened ... but yeah , not really my thing either ! :P
I'm Australian , I know what you mean though :P But yeah they're pretty much all the same thing really ...
I'm not sure what the difference is between them and just plain shirts ... But yeah if it's cold out then probably a tee would be better for me ! :D Thanks guys lt 3
He's not the one who made that call , it was Ramos ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I think it's pretty clear that they didn't even bother to read the whole thing before posting their comment here .. lol ! :P Edit : grammar
It wasn't really Indian , but I think the food is still very similar in terms of spices and ingredients used for cooking . It just had a different name back then ! :P Edit spelling error ...
I think he's better than Curry . I'd take him over Steph any day of the week , but not this game .
I thought that too but I think the kick hit him in his chest and he got up to block it ? Idk though ... just a guess lol ! Thanks for clearing this out tho ' :D D: lt 3
I think the Cavs are looking for someone who can play off ball and help them win games , but that's just my guess though ...
I'm sorry .
I'm pretty sure that's what happened .
I'm not saying it was , but I think that is what they were trying to do with all of those teams and their owners'money ...
I think the guy in front of him did too . I'm not sure though , because he didn't say anything at all ... but that's what happened ! :D
Sony is a big part of Marvel's success , so they probably want to keep their hands off him until he gets his own movie .
They're not playing well . They've been on a roll lately , but they have no excuse for losing that game last week and their first two games in SF .
I'm a big fan of the album . I think it's called The End Of Days by The Beatles but that might be because I've listened to them before ...
I've never heard that before , but I'll keep it in mind for the future ! Thanks a lot :D lt 3
I'm not sure , but if you're going for the gold then it's probably best just to let people enjoy your comment .
I'm not sure if that's legal in most states . I'll have to look into it ! Thanks for the tip though :D Edit : Nevermind ... It is illegal here lolololloloopsies.jpg
That was the first thing I thought when seeing this picture ! It's so eerie , and yet somehow very real ...
I think you're thinking of r neckbeardism ... which is not really what this sub was made for ! :P But thanks anyway lolololllll lt 3
I'm sure they're all laughing their heads off right now ...
I know but still ...
I'm sure he'll be fine , but if you're going down there for a while ... don't forget your towel and bring it home .
Thanks man really looking forward too it :D
I'm sure the US will be happy with this , too ... oh wait .. nvm ! :P I'll show myself out now lololollolooolooowwwwwwoooooohhhahahahaahhhaaawwaaaahhhhhhhhheeeeeeheeewaaaaaaaaghuhuughuuugghgjehbwhbbbsdeeyupvihfhdkdfdhqnxmndsgdzcbdpjs ?
And the only thing he knows about football , is that it's not real !
Because the Russian government doesn't want her . She's a Ukrainian citizen , so they don t care about that part of their country at all ... s
I'm a kid and I've never seen that show . What's it about ?
I think you mean condiments , but yes it's basically just an appliance that serves as the same thing in different ways and shapes ...
I think they should rename themselves to NA Mid Caps Jokesters and then move back into Europe .
I think that's a good point , though I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... Either way thanks for answering ! :D
I've been meaning to get that one too ! It's a shame it didn't come out on the PS3 ...
I'm not even sure what the point of this comment is anymore ... ?
He's not dead , he just got better at golfing and has been playing for the last few years ...
I don't think so , he was just really angry . He didn t even know what happened to him until I told him about the incident and how bad of an accident ... lol ! :D lt 3
I'm sure they'll be fine , but it's not like they're going to have a lot in common with each other anyway ! s
I don t think so . I ve never had any issues with my windows being scratched or anything like that , but you re right about the glass shattering on impact .
I'm not sure what you're getting at , but I think it's pretty obvious he was joking about how animals are more likely to eat plants than humans ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take it as sarcasm and upvote anyway ! :D Thanks for the laugh though haha x3 lt 3
It's not ? I thought it was just fantasy ...
I'm not sure what's worse ... being arrested for having an opinion or getting shot by police officers because of your opinions on things ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but this is a good point and one of my favorite quotes from The Doctor's dialogue with Clara .
I was thinking the same thing ! I love that movie so much , and this is one of my favorite covers ever made for it too :D
I think it's a good thing that they're not in my country , then ! :D I'm sure you'll find some interesting ones to watch though ...
I'm sure they have an app for that , but I don't know if it's available in all countries or not ...
I'm sure you're a great guy and all ... But that's not what the law says !
He was a KGB agent . He knew what he did , and it wasn't even illegal ! s
I'm a tattoo artist . I can confirm that you are indeed the tattoo haver ! :D
I'm not seeing it ... ? I don't know what to tell ya ' ..
Nor me , I'm just an ordinary human being who happens to be in the same situation as you are and have no idea what's going on here ...
I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing ... I think it would be better to just let them do their job than have the police intervene for me ! :P Thanks though lt 3
I think he's one if my favorite wrestlers to watch and I'm from New York so that makes me feel good about him being an awesome guy ! :D DD
I think it's a bit higher than that , but I'm not sure what his motivation is exactly ...
Spotify is a great service but I don't think they have ads in their app ...
I'm sure he's got some sort of security clearance or something ... right guys ! Guys .. ? s
He's not even 30 yet . He was drafted in the second round and has been playing since he turned 21 , so yeah ...
I'd watch that movie !
Bad D .
Nah he's just a troll who thinks the word'nani means no in Japanese ... I think ..
I have a cat that does this too ! I think it's because she knows you're not going to eat her food , so she just wants some attention for herself ? :P lololollolo
He's not playing . He was subbed off for the second half of this match , and he didn't play in that game either ... so I guess it doesn t matter anymore .. :P EDIT : spelling error fixed now lolz xD sorry guys lt 3
The CIA ?
You're a good man .
He's not a citizen .
I'm in the same boat as you ...
Because he's not wearing his shirt . It was just an example of how much I dislike this gimmick and that particular attire is so overused on TV shows now ...
SKT T1 K , SSG B , and KT Rolster C are all in Korea right now so they're not eligible to play worlds yet either ... but I'm sure it's still possible ! edit spelling error lolz xD
He's just trying out for the next game . He'll be fine in a few minutes , but it will take some time before his body can handle that much pressure again ...
I was thinking it looked like a late 90s Ford F 150 , but I could be wrong ...
I was thinking more like a young Sarah Palin or something ... but I guess that works too ! :D Thanks for your input though !
You're not supposed too , it's just for the sake if you don't want your joints all sticky and stuffy ! :P I'm sorry ...
I'm a Warriors and Cavs fan so ... good ?
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I don't think it's an election , but rather a referendum or some other vote for one candidate in each party .
I'm pretty sure that was a joke , but I don't know enough about Kirby lore or anything like it for this comment so ... yeah ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I'll take it as a compliment ! :D Thanks for the heads up though ...
I'm sure you're a great person , but I don't think that is what happened here ...
I think it's more that the movie was terrible . It had some good moments but overall I thought it wasn't very interesting or creative at all ...
I'm from Wisconsin and have lived here for 20 years now ... this one's definitely not south carolina though lol but it does look like it could be somewhere near there ? Maybe even north or east coast .. maybe haha edit spelling error fixx
I'm not crying . It's just raining on me ...
I think so ! I'm not sure though ...
I'd watch that ! I love me some McGonagins , but he's not exactly my type ...
I'm pretty sure that's a reference to something else . I think it was in one of those movies where he gets kidnapped and has his head chopped off ? Something like this ...
I love TalkTalk , but I'm not sure if it fits what OP is looking for ...
I don t know , but I m sure they do ! s
He's a pretty big guy , I think he'd be more likely than any of them being there for Easter eggs ... but maybe that was just my imagination ? ! Haha :D
He was a good actor though ! He just had to be the most charismatic person in that movie and it worked out for him somehow lololollolooolooohhhahahaahahhhaa haaa ahahahaaaaaahhhhhhhh hahaaaa oh god why ? I don't know what happened but still funny nonetheless :D LOLOLOoooooOOHAA HAHA
It's not like they're going for a full moon knight , but it would be cool if he was in there somewhere ... I mean , we already got night wing and batman though .. ? ! s :P lol jkjkljksljljslsllsbsdsbzdssgdfhfhsfsdhfdgsxddnsnndcwqmfgghhh
I'll give them a discount on that one ! :D
Secret Wars was pretty good imo and Galactica had some great moments too ! I'd love for them all together again though :D
If you're looking at a phone with an SD card slot and can't afford to buy another one then go ahead ... it's not like they'll be cheaper than now anyway lol .. :P Good luck though man lt 3333333 3333333 3 0
I love the little ones ! They're so cute .
I think she's going to win the next one and then be eliminated from contention for this season ... I hope ! :D
I think that was a joke . He's not actually going to do it , but I'm sure they'll make him laugh and say something like this is what we're all here about ! ...
I'm sure you're not the only one who's seen that statistic before ...
I'm sure you could find a job that pays more than your salary in the US ...
You're the best ! Thanks for your help , it's much appreciated :D
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . I don't think it's that hard , but the fact is he was sleeping in his car and woke himself up with an alarm clock ... ? !
I'm in the same boat as you ... but with a different player !
I think it's more of an ego thing than anything else ... I mean he is probably just really good at making people feel better about themselves and stuff .. but still ! :P lololollolo
I think he's going for that sweet , sweet karma from his post history .
He's like a young , fat kid . I love it !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just really high , but that's pretty much my life right now ... except for the occasional game of league lol :P But yeah it is nice ! haha xD lt 3
I think they're trying , but it's not working so far ...
Buy a boat .
I'm sorry to hear that . I hope your computer is okay !
I'm not a Jedi yet ! I need more training first ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling . But he's actually been pretty decent for us this year and has had some great games against bad teams in his career ... ? ! s Edit : spelling error fixed it
I've been there ! It's great fun but I'm not sure if it would be suitable as an adult ?
I'm going with both , but I think he's gonna die at some point during that scene and be a major part of it all ...
Happy Birthday to you too :D Happy early birthdays !
I'm doing it right now , but my brain is just so tired from all of this screaming that I don t even know what's going on anymore ! :D
It is , but not as much as you'd think ...
It's not about the quality , it is just that people are more interested in what you think than others who don't care to see your work or whatever ... ? I dunno .. shrug ! :P
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of the fact that they have an extra week to prepare for next season . Either way , I laughed at it anyway ! :D lt 3 Penn Staterry
The owner is a private company , so I'm not sure if they own it or just have some sort of relationship with them ... but that would be my guess anyway ! :P Edit : spelling error fixed .. lolololoolllll
It's a very happy face !
I'm down for a game ! I'll be on around 7:30 pm EST tonight if that's good with everyone else ?
I'm sure it wasn t a lot of trash , but I bet there were some good old fashioned racists in that truck too ! s
I think so !
Yeah , but you can just use them to get around and stuff like this is pretty easy if your not too far away from it or something ... ? :P I dunno though .. lol ! XD xD lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious , but that's actually an actual movie and it is very good ! It has some great actors in it too ...
He's probably not even that fat . He looks like an average guy in his 20s to me and I'm only 5 ' 8 so ... yeah ?
I've seen them in Finland as well !
I'm not sure what you mean by that ...
I'm glad you enjoyed ! The story was so good , that i had to share with everyone who would like more details about what happened in the book :D Thanks for reading ! lt 3
I think it's more that he didn t have a car . He had to walk around in his snowmobile for like 10 minutes before getting back home ...
It was a good call , but I think it should have been called back on review for offsides or something like that ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I think that's a pretty good point to make about this particular case ! Thanks for sharing OP :D lt 3
I think he's already a big name in Hollywood , but I agree with you on his acting chops and potential as an actor ! He looks like a great fit for Star Wars ...
I'm a dude , but thanks for the compliment ! :D I'll keep it in mind if my next encounter is anything like this one was ... lololollolooolooowwwwwwoooooohhhahahaahahaaaahhhaaaaaaaaawwweeeeewooooooooooo
I would , but I'm not sure if the freezer is big enough . It's a small apartment and we have no fridge or oven so ... yeah probably wouldn't be worth waiting for ! :P lolololllllzhahahahaahhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
He didn t say anything bad though ... He just said it s not good for business and was very pro free trade but also anti immigration policies so we can t have them here !
I'm sorry to hear about your situation , but at least you got a free game ! That's all the good stuff is for right ? :D Good luck with everything else though lt 3
I've only ever gotten to 9.5 k . I'm a little surprised that it's so low for me !
They were going to the bathroom .
I got a full time position with no benefits . I'm not sure what the starting pay is , but it's pretty good for an entry level position in my area of expertise ! :D Edit : spelling error ...
You're a good person , and you should feel bad for not liking it ! :D
I've never had this problem before ... But now you mention it .. It could be a bug or something ! Thanks for your help though :D lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a troll ... but it's funny because the Chinese government is actually banning people from wearing burkas and other religious symbols as well ! :D D: lt 3
I'm going to go ahead and say that's not what it means ... but you're welcome ! :D
I was expecting a comedy , but I guess it is more like the first half of The Big Lebowski than anything else ...
I think it's more of an addiction . He has been using the same gun for years now and he still can't get rid off his habit ! :D
He's not fit enough to play in the CL . He'll be back for next week though , he just needs a rest after that match against Sevilla and then we can start him ! :D D: lt 3
I'm not sure if I should be excited or scared that this is happening ...
I think they should do a prequel to episode 3 , and then make it into an anthology film with all three films in one series ? That'd work really well ! :D Edit : spelling ...
It's the same thing as playing with your feet on the ground and then stepping out of bounds to get back in time for another shot or something similar ...
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad ... but either way your living room is pretty ugly and you're probably going through some serious grief right now ! :P Good luck though man ..
And then the icecream is melted and eaten by all three .
I think you mean foxy cats , but I agree that they're pretty much identical in terms of temperament and behavior ! :D
Or a baby with cancer , or an infant that's born without a brain and has no idea what it is doing in its sleep ...
I'm sorry for your loss , my friend !
Fool Me Once ... Fool You Twice ?
That's what happens when you have no idea how things work in your country , but are willing to believe it because of some internet video game character that looks like him ...
It's a joke . It is not real , but it has happened before and will happen again if enough people are stupid enough for their own good ! s
I'm not seeing it , what's going on ? I can't see anything ... EDIT : Nevermind ! It worked now lol thanks for the help though man haha xD
I think he was on the McGregor camp . He's a big fan of his and wanted to fight him in Brazil , but I don't know if that happened yet ... Edit : spelling error ! Thanks u danielleknightzombie for correcting me lolololooololllllooooooowwwwwwooooshhhahahahahaohhhaaawwaaaaaahhhhhhhhheeeeeeellooooooooooyyyyeeaaayuuuuhhhhhhahahaaaaghhhhh
I'm sure they would be able and willing if you gave them a chance ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of me . But I love that show ! It's so funny and topical at times like this too ...
I'm sure there's some kind of loophole in the law to allow this ...
I think you mean the movie , not the videogame ... but I'm sure there are plenty of people who would enjoy it ! :D
I think it's called The Office ? I don't remember him being in anything else , though ...
I'm not sure what the difference is between being charged with a crime and having your rights violated . I think it's just that they're different crimes , right now ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I think the joke is that he's married to his wife and she murdered him with her own gun ? !
I think it's more like 2019 , but I could see that happening too if they're going to release a new version of Unity in 2018 or something ... :P Edit spelling ! D: lt 3
I'm still here , just not at work ... but it's Tuesday !
I think you mean fungi .
I know , but I'm saying that it doesn't feel like he is doing anything else than just being in character for this video . It feels more like an improv scene to me ! :P ...
It was a karate class , but it wasn't the one I'm thinking of ...
I think he's more of a captain america . He has the same powers as cap and is also an avenger so it makes sense to have him in there too ! :D DDHahahaha ... hahahaa ..
I'm not sure , but if they have to ask for your name and address then yes probably !
I feel like that was more of an accident than anything else ... but yeah it's still sad to see her go from being so popular with the community as well ! : c lt 3
I'm paying about the same as he is , but my school has an annual fee of around 800 for students who are not attending classes or taking courses online ...
I'm not sure what you mean by that but if your plan is a flat rate then yes they do charge more than 1 month per year ...
I'm not getting my hopes high ... I just want to know what he said and why he did that ?
I'm sorry but your job is not as easy or fun as mine !
I'm sure they do ... but I don't think that will be enough for them not being able or willing too change their minds on something like this .. :P !
I think so . I'm not sure though ...
I've never been to one of those but I'm sure they're great !
I'm not sure what that is , but I'll look into it . Thanks ! :D lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious , but he's a great actor and I think that was the joke ... ?
I'm not sure if I should be offended or happy that you think this is a good idea ...
You don't . You just have to be willing and able , but not stupid enough for that .
He has a lot of powers but I think his most important one would be strength and durability . He can't even beat Batman with those two things combined ! s
I think you mean Toy Story 4 : The Search For More Money
I think it's a great show , but I'm not sure if that was one of my favorite episodes or what ... But yeah he did an amazing job in this season .. lolololoolllllooooooooloooowwwwwwweweelldddeeerrrrrbbbeeeeehahahahaha :D lt 3
I'm not a tourist . I just like to go there for the scenery and food ! :D
I'm not sure what you're talking about . Luigi is one of my favorite characters and his inclusion would be great !
I'm not sure if I should be scared or excited about this ...
How do we get the new update ?
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad for this guy ...
I was expecting the same thing , but I think he's too busy being an actor and not actually doing anything with his life ...
I'm not sure what you mean by this . I don't think anyone is saying that they shouldn't be ranked , just that it should only matter to the top players in their division ... ? ! s
It was a joke , but I guess you didn't get the sarcasm ... ? :P
I'm not sure what you're trying here , but I think the word is juxtaposition ?
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this .
I'm not sure what I was thinking when writing this . But yes ! That's exactly how it works in my experience with cats and dogs as well ...
I think he's gonna be like that guy who was on the cover of Madden . He'll carry you guys for years , but eventually get injured or something ?
I'm sure you can find a way around it if your name is in there somewhere ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling , because I don't think that is a real reason for it being so low ...
You're not a real person until you've had an autist as your teacher's pet or something like that ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it's a good point regardless of whether they are aware about gun control laws ...
It did not unfortunately ... but you can try again tomorrow if needed and see what happens lololollolo
It was the same for me last year . I'm not sure why , but that series felt like an eternity waiting to happen ... until it did !
I think it's just a vocal fry . He sounds like that in real life too , but I don't know if there are any recordings where you can hear him scream . :P Edit spelling error ! D: lt 3 u bbzkazu ?
I'm not sure if I should laugh at this comment . Or cry ...
Ohhh , I see ! Thanks for explaining it :D
I'm not sure if you're serious but I think he's going to be the next president of America and it will be a disaster for him personally ...
I'm sure they're not doing it for the money , but because of their job title and responsibilities in a corporate environment ...
I'm sure you'll be able too , but the point is that they're not going anywhere without your permission and consent ... so don't worry about them getting in trouble with the government .. ? :P s
I think it's more of an expression thing , but I could be wrong ...
I'd like to buy one too ! Thanks in advance OP ...
I think he's a bit too tall for me , but I'm not sure about that one ...
They're playing like they've been there for years . They have a lot of experience and are very good at it , so why not ?
I don't know , but I'm sure the answer would be infinite .
Because the people who make these things have no idea what they're doing . They think that's how everything works , and then they get fired for not following instructions correctly ... or something like this ! s
That's the best way to get them interested in you !
I'm sure you could find a way to make it work on the Galaxy S4 , but I don't think that's what they were going for with this one ...
It's a meme . It doesn't have to be funny , just something that makes you laugh and make people smile at your misfortune !
I'm sure you can find a way to make him happy with some of those things ... but it will be hard for most people ! :D
I'm not sure what the difference is between dutch and english but I've heard of people who speak both languages in school ...
I'm not bitter or anything , I just think he's a bad person who should never be allowed to run for public office again because his policies are terrible ... s ?
Yeah , I've seen a few people from there on here too !
Thanks ! I'll need it , haha ...
I'm not sure what you're talking about ... I've had symptoms for a week and they haven't gone away yet ! ?
I'm sure they're still there ... just not in the same place as before ! :D I mean .. it's a good thing that we have all these people here now and then ? lol jk lt 3 u bbz xoxo
I'm not joking , I think it's just the way things are headed now that they're in control of everything ...
I'll be fine ... just a bit tired now !
You can't do that with a single finger though ...
It's the eyes and mouth movements that make it look like a cat is trying to eat you or something ...
The V1 is pretty good , and you can get them on Amazon.com right away if your local store doesn t have one yet !
I think it's because of how much time was spent on the characters and their backstory , but I could be wrong about this one ...
I'm not sure if you're being serious ... But I think that's a pretty accurate statement in this case !
I'm not sure what you mean by that but I think it's pretty clear they don't care about the fact that NK has nuke subs on their borders ... ? ! s
I was thinking more like an engine that explodes and leaves a crater in its wake , but I guess you're right !
You're right that's why they don't teach us in school anymore lolol Edit :D
He's a great player , but he has no business being in that conversation with Westbrook and Curry IMO ...
Yeah , I think that's what they were going for . It was just an unfortunate choice of words on my part :P
Because they're in the same city and there's only 1 store that sells beer at all times on the island I think .. haha edit good luckedonger
He's not going anywhere . He'll be back for the playoffs and he will win another title with us again next year ! s
I think it's a reference from an episode of The Office .
I've been doing this for years now ... It's not a bad gig at all !
I saw one there last night , but I didn't see any of the other ones yet !
I'm not sure if that was a joke or not but it made me laugh . Thanks for sharing ! :D
You're a robot , duh !
His ult is pretty bad , but it's not that much worse then the other ones in terms of damage or range ...
It's not even a good idea , it just sounds too much like a spinoff of Breaking Bad . It'd be more likely than anything else they could do with him in the show ...
I'm listening now , thanks !
It's not you . It was a good movie , but I don t think that s what this is about at all ...
I think you mean tools are entering stone age ?
I'm from there ! I was just wondering if it's a common thing to do or something ...
It's a reference from The Simpsons ... I think it was called Skeleton Key or something like that ? It just sounds right ! :D Edit : spelling and all ..
I'm not sure if I should be offended or happy that someone else is so concerned about my health ! Haha :D But thanks for the concern anyway lt 3
Because he's not a superhero . He just likes to give presents and is always there for you when things go wrong , but it doesn t mean anything if he s dead or alive ... right guys ! Right .. ? Guys ?
upvoted u too please back me
I'm not sure if you're serious , but I've never heard of this term before and it sounds like a great idea ! Thanks for the suggestion :D
I've never had an apple sauce that wasn't amazing . I'm not a fan of the texture , though ...
u matt 2143 and I have a lot of respect for him . He's been around the sub since it started , so he deserves some love too ! lt 3
I'm sure it is , but if he was going to get a new one anyway ... why not have an old one for him and his friends family ? :P
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious ... but I'll take it as a compliment :D Thanks for the feedback and congrats on your progress too ! lt 3
I'm a guy and I've been on this sub for about 3 years now ... so yes ? :P
I'm from Houston and I've never seen a single one of those , but there are plenty around here ...
War has changed . It's no longer about who is left standing and whose side to take !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ... but I think it's funny either way ! :D
I'm in FL and I've never heard of this law before ... but that's awesome ! Thanks for sharing your knowledge about our laws :D
Because it's not a vaccine . It is an injection of some sort that can be administered by doctors and nurses without any medical background or training whatsoever ...
I'm not sure if I should be scared or excited about this ...
I'm sorry . I don't speak English very well and my phone autocorrects to cumbersome when typing on the internet sometimes ... Thanks for pointing out ! :D lt 3
I'm not sure if you're serious or just trolling but TL is a pretty good team and they have been playing well lately so far in the season ... ? ! s
The Elons are in this town , and they're all out to get us .
I'm sure they could do it with the technology available to them now ... but yeah you're right about the cost being too high on this one ! :P
The Big Lebowski ?
And eating a lot of candy !
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun . I hope it's both ! :D
I'm not saying it's true , but I think the theory is pretty plausible if you look at all of their other videos on YouTube ...
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote you .
I didn't even see it until you pointed out , but yeah ... crazy expensive for a 5 mana card lololollolooolooowwwwwwoooooohhh
I'm sure he'll be able to afford it , but I doubt that's the reason for his decision making ...
I'm sure you're not the only one who's heard of this , but I've never been to any country that would have laws against it ... yet here we are ! :D
I'm not sure if I should upvote or down vote this comment ...
I'm sure the twins are just as bad . They're both from New Zealand , and they've been known to be quite violent in their past lives ...
I'm in the same boat as you ! Except mine starts tomorrow ... so yeah ..
They're too busy playing Hearthstone and not getting enough sleep to play anymore , I guess ? :P
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but I think that's a pretty good point and would probably make for an interesting case .
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad . I'll take either way ! :D
It's not like he was going for the money , it just happened that way ...
Sniffs , I like that .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but it's a reference to the show The Wire .
I've been taking B12 supplements for years , but it's not a good idea because the body can't process them properly without some kind or other .
It was Thursday for me and I'm still here ! :D
I do this too . It's a lot easier to hit with your left hand than right and you can get more power out from that side as well !
I think it was a little more than that ... he had to go through the bathroom for about 10 minutes after that !
I think that's what happened to me in The Flyin'Circus ...
I'm sure he'll be fine , but I'd like to see him try it on his own first !
Justice is a good one . I think it fits well with what you're saying , and also sounds more fitting for this sub than most other ones that have been suggested here ! Thanks again lt 3333 u dogetipbot verify 1.5 Doge verify
I'm not sure if you're serious or just a joke ... but that was the first thing my mind went to when i saw this picture ! :D
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that we scored .
It's a good thing you didn't then ! :P
You're not alone in that opinion !
I think you mean clone .
I think it's more likely that the person who is in control of this account has a very good reason to be paranoid about something they know nothing about , and thus doesn't care ...
I've tried this but my kid is too lazy for tricks like that lol ! She just eats everything in sight haha :P Thanks though !
Lol you're right . I'm not sure why people are so surprised by this tbh ...
I'm a Marine Biologist and I've never had an issue with that .
We thank Russia , but we are not going to give them anything in return ... We have no interest whatsoever with this situation at hand !
I'm pretty sure it was a bronze team with no legends or anything like that ... I think there were only 3 players in their league at one point ?
I'm sorry for your loss . I hope you have an amazing time in LA !
I'm pretty sure that's a woman , and she is doing it in her sleep ...
You're not the only one ! We've got you covered on r spacedicks too if that's what your into ...
I'm 27 . He's 28 now ... but yeah it was a long time ago for me too !
You don t have a car . You just walk around in shorts and flip flops all day long ! s

I'm sure they're all dead by now , but I'll take it !
I am 35 and have a cat that looks like this one !
I'm not sure if you are being sarcastic or serious ... but I think the US has been involved with this for years and decades ?
I still use google images for this reason ... I don't even have a computer and just googled something that looked cool or interesting so i could find more pictures of things ! :D D: lt 3
He's been playing great lately , but he has to be the best player in this series by far right now imo ...
You're a good man , Dad !
I'm from Redondo too , but I live in the East Bay now so it's not as much of an issue for me haha :P
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun of me but I love that comparison !
I'd watch that . I'm not a big fan of either fighter , but they're both entertaining fighters and it would be interesting to see them in the same cage together again ! :D Edit : spelling error ...
I'd probably just go to sleep or something ...
I'm not sure what you mean by this ? Are they all just kids who have no idea how to use a computer or something like that ... sry for being ignorant :P !
They're both laughing at the same time , so I'm guessing that's what is going on here ! :D
I'm not going to read it , but I'll be sure and check back here when they come out ! Thanks for letting me know though :D
I'm sure it's not a problem for them . They have plenty more than enough space on earth , and they can just use their own oceans as well ... right ? Right guys .. ? Guys ? :D D:
It's a good thing they didn't have to worry about that then ! :P
How do you know that there are more than four people who haven t ever touched the game . I m sure we ve seen a lot on here , but not everyone has .. lolololoollooooloooowwwwwwoooooohhhahahaahahaaaahhhaaawwaaaaaaaattttuuuuhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeewoooooooooonnnnggggghjklllkklaaaaaaanauughhhhrrrrbbzzzsss

Google Messenger
I'm sure he's going for the presidency after all ! He'll be able get his way out of that one somehow I bet .. s
I think it's more like an engineer .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think that's a pretty good reason why most of us are skeptical about this whole thing ...
I think it's a good call . It would have been close but I don't see how they could overturn it if he didn t touch it with his hand on top of him ? ! s ... wait .. what are we talking about again lolololllzzzZZZLOLOoooooOOoooohhhhhhahahahaha
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making fun ... but I like your username and would love some GUMBos in my life right now ..
That's fair enough !
What's your favorite color ? Mine is blue , but it doesn't matter if you're a fan or not !
I'm sure you can find some way to get around that pesky space time continuum !
I'm not sure what's going to happen , but if it does ... You're gonna have a bad time ! :D
Fallout 3 . I've played both , but the story is better in NV and it's more immersive to me than FO3 ' s .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic , but I think it's funny that the senate is basically just an office for senators and their staff ...
He's not even in his final form yet . He needs to be more aggressive and take control of this game , he'll learn from this mistake easily ! s
I've been there . It's a beautiful city , but I don't think it would be for me if the weather was cold enough that my feet were freezing in winter ... lol ! :P hahaahahaahahhhaa haaaaahhhahahaaaaaaa
I was thinking that too . I'm not sure if it's a good thing or bad , though ...
It was just an example to show how much they can do with CGI and what not but yeah I agree that there is some poor animation here or there ...
I think he's talking about his performance against us last year when we were up by 20 and had to play him for most of it ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that this is happening .
The Hobbit was pretty good , and it's not even close to the same level of visual prowess as The Dark Knight Rises or Batman Begins .
I'm actually from New York . But thanks anyway :D
I'm sure he'd be fine with it , but I don't think the dog would either ...
I'm not sure if you're serious or just making a joke , but I've never heard of that before and it's hilarious ! :D
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . Either way , it's a good idea ! :D
I'm sure you can find a way around that ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or serious , but I think the word is juxtaposition ?
The Browns did it to us last year , but we won anyway so ...
I think you mean'The Mile High Club . '
He's on the card , but it is a co main for UFC 200 and 202 so they're going to have him call that one instead of this one ...
I thought the same thing , but I'm not sure if that's a good or bad sign ...
That would be awesome . I think it's called the Mojave , but that doesn't sound right ...
I think he was a producer on both movies and they were all his films ... I could be wrong though .. but it seems like this guy has some connections with Marvel studios ? ! :D Edit spelling error lolololoolllllzzzzzzzZZZ Zizzo
The guy with a bomb .
They're not , but it's still a lot of cash for them to be making movies at all and that is what makes this so great !
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
I think you mean South Korea , but I agree with your sentiment nonetheless !

I'm pretty sure that's what they call it in Japan too ...
I think you mean mostly wood .
I think they're just his normal clothes . I'm not sure though , it looks like he has a pair of shoes on too ... maybe that is what you are seeing ! :D
You can't . You're a cat , and you have to be careful about what your friends think of you because they'll get jealous if you do that ! :P
I'm not sure , but I think it's a good idea to have him be in this movie . He was great as Spidey and he can bring some comedy into the film ! :D DDHahahaha ...
He's a pro . He knows how to use his phone !
He's not a criminal , he was just trying to get his car back from someone who stole it illegally .
I predict the Cavs to win by a lot more than they won last year and I'm not even an NBA fan lolololloloooloo
I think that's the best way for me too ! :D Thanks again , and good luck with your future endeavors in life as well lt 3
I feel like I am the only one who thinks that's funny , but it is still pretty sad ...
I'm sorry I don't know what you're talking about ... but yes he's saying there are a lot more people who want this than say they do !
You're in for a treat . It's one of the best games ever made , and it has some great music too !
I'm sure they have the technology to do it in their own home studio or something like that but I don't think anyone would want to risk getting caught for fraud ! s ? :P
I thought it was a picture at first . I'm not sure why , but that's what he looks like when you're looking through his eyes and stuff ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad about the upgrade ...
I'm sorry , I didn't know that was a rule ! Thanks for letting me know though and deleting it now ... Sorry about the inconvenience !
I was thinking this exact same thing , but it's just because of how he fell down and landed on his head ...
I'm not sure if you're serious , but that's a quote from The Last Temptation .
