I don't think that's how it works ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what happened .
It's a great game , but it doesn't come close to that level of awesomeness !
Sounds like a plan to me !
Thank you ! That means a lot to me lt 3
I don't think I've ever heard him say anything bad about the packers and he's always been one of my favorite players growing up .
I'm not sure about that , but it's a good idea to check and see if you can't find them in your area .
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... I thought it was pretty funny !
That sounds about right , thanks !
I don't know if I should laugh or cry .
Wow , that's a lot faster than I was able to do ! Keep up the good work !
I don't know , but I'd like to see them try .
Spanner is what I was going to go with as well !
I don't think I've ever been so happy to see a comment get downvoted in such a short amount of time ...
I don't think so . He's not going to be able to keep up with the top guys in his weight class and he doesn't have that kind of power .
I don't know why you're being downvoted because this is a very good point that I hadn't considered .
I don't even know what that is , but I'll take your word for it .
I did , but I don't think that's what he was getting at .
That's what she said !
I don't know why you're being downvoted when it's true ...
I don't think you know what that word means ...
That's what I was going to say . It looks like something out of a horror movie !
I don't know the name of it , but there's a place called Sushi Shibuya in Capitol Hill that has some really good sashimi !
Yes , but it's more common than you'd think because of the number of babies that are born each year .
Because it's awesome .
That's a good idea , I'll look into that . Thanks !
I don't know why you're being downvoted for having an honest opinion on the matter .
I'm sorry for your loss .
I'd buy it just to have him as a playable character !
That's what I'm thinking as well , but we'll see how it plays out in a couple of days .
I'm not sure if you're being serious , but that's exactly what it is !
I'm not sure what you're trying to say with that comment ...
I think he's referring to the fact that it doesn't make any sense in this context , but I could be wrong .
Nah , he's just trying to get his name out there as much as possible so people will tune in for the next fight .
It's free if you sign up for the Google Play Music Unlimited plan , which includes spotify and other music streaming services .
That's not how it works ...
I don't know if I should laugh or cry .
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... It's true !
I've had mine for 3 years now and they're still holding up great !
I don't think Khabib is the type of guy to go out on a limb and say he's going to get punched in the face or something like that .
That's a great idea , thanks !
I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess you're Irish ?
That's what she said ?
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
I don't know why you're being downvoted because this is a very valid point .
I wouldn't . Keuchel is a top 5 pitcher in the league , and he's only going to get better from here on out .
I don't know why I didn't think of that ... Thanks !
It's not that he doesn't deserve a chance ... it's the fact that there are so many better players out there who aren't getting any playing time right now .
That's the spirit !
It would be a fun game , especially if it was at home !
I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that about any of their shows ...
I don't think that word means what you think it means ...
That's a good idea , I'll keep that in mind !
Yes , he did ! He's the one who got me into this sub in the first place :D
It's the same reason I don't use my phone for long periods of time , so it doesn't bother me at all .
I'm sorry to hear that but at least it's not as bad as having one or more of them in the same room with each other ...
Zenyatta and Tracer have already been confirmed to be getting a skin , so I don't think it's too far fetched at this point .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not ...
I don't think you know what that word means .
I don't think you're allowed to have more than 3 WRs on the field at one time in a game ...
That's what I'm sayin ' !
This is the only correct answer .
Bamboozled again ?
I don't think that's how it works ...
He was born and raised in New York City , I believe .
I don't think so , but I'm not an expert on the subject .
I think they were talking about the rework , but I could be wrong .
That's what she said !
I don't know , but I'm sure you'll find out soon enough .
What do you mean by QR codes ?
Haha , I'm glad someone else did too !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's true !
Thank you so much ! That means a lot to me :D
Yeah , but I don't think Trump would be able to beat him in a fight ...
I don't know why I'm being downvoted ...
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say you don't need one .
That's what I was hoping for , but it didn't happen !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is the most likely explanation .
I haven't noticed it yet but I'll keep an eye out !
It would be nice , but I don't see that happening anytime soon .
That's what we thought last year and look how that turned out ...
No , it's because they're made of copper .
That's actually a really good idea , thanks !
That's not what I'm saying , but okay .
I'm sure it was . He's a good boy !
You have no idea what you are talking about do you ?
It's definitely up there for me as well , but I still think Suicide Squad is the best of them all .
I got an email saying my package had been shipped and that it would be in the mail within a day or two .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but I like it !
Pineapple is a fruit , so no .
That's what they tell me !
I don't know why I didn't think of that , thanks !
I don't think she's been played competitively in quite some time so I'm not sure what you're talking about .
I can't wait to see what they come up with !
Rogue one was great , but I don't see how it could have been better than A New Hope or Revenge of the Sith .
That's the spirit !
Thank you so much ! That means a lot :D
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what I do !
I don't know why , but this made me laugh more than it should have .
Vertonghen is one of the best CBs in the game and he's only going to get better !
That's what I was thinking but didn't want to get my hopes up just in case :P
I don't think you know how divisions work ...
I don't think you know what that word means ...
That's actually a really good idea . Thanks !
What was the question ?
I don't know what to do with my hands !
I'm sure you can find someone who will do it , just give me a few days and I'll see what I can come up with :D
You don't need an excuse when you're rich .
I'm not sure what you mean by stomps and getting stomped but I agree that it should be an option for people who are new to the game .
It's not like he won't be back for Mania or anything ...
I don't think it's possible for them to have been in the same room at the same time as each other ... but you never know !
I don't think that's how it works ...
I don't think I've ever been so happy to be wrong !
I don't know why you're being downvoted for having a different opinion then everyone else in this thread ...
Cider isn't a fruit though ...
Alfonse is still a good starter , but he doesn't really have much of an impact on your team if you're not using him at all .
I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's all three .
I don't know about that , but I'm pretty sure it's going to be very hard for them to get rid of their incumbents this time around .
I don't think that's what you're getting at ...
That's a good point , I'll have to check it out !
I have all of them except snow owl , but that's a good one too !
That's what she said .
I don't see why not , it's just a matter of knowing when and where to put them :P
I'm not sure , but I think it might have something to do with money .
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted , there are plenty of people who don't want to admit they were wronged by betas and have no interest in playing again .

I don't know , but it's better than nothing !
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote you for this comment , but it made me laugh so hard !
I'm sorry for your loss .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's pretty much my experience as well .
I think it's safe to say that gambling isn't a good idea in this situation .
I don't think you know what that word means ...
I'm going to go with TheBigAnus .
That's what I figured . Thanks !
That's what she said !
Me too ! Where are you ?
I would have been more surprised if they didn't show it , but that's just me .
It would be better if he didn't throw him into jail at all ...
I don't know , but I'm pretty sure it's a glitch in the matrix .
Baszler isn't even a top 10 fighter in his own weight class ...
He's been pretty good so far , but he hasn't really had a chance to get going yet .
I don't think so , but I could be wrong .
That's what she said .
It's a bold strategy Cotton , let's see if it pays off for them !
I've never been so happy to have missed a penalty in my life !
That's not how revolutions work ...
I don't think I've ever met anyone who didn't speak English as their first language , let alone a native one .
Red Son is one of my all time favorite books , but it doesn't hold a candle to the rest of his work .
That's not true at all , there are still plenty of people who don't know how to play the game and have no idea what they're talking about .
Is your cat dead ?
I don't think that's how it works ...
Thank you so much ! Have a nice day :D
It's one of my all time favorite shows ! Definitely worth watching if you're into that sort of thing .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it's a reference to an episode of Seinfeld where Kramer says something like that .
You and me both , brother .
I've never met a cat I didn't think was going to attack me at some point in the next few years .
I don't think you know what that word means .
I don't know , but I'd like to see her do it with two hands on each side of the handlebar .
I don't know why , but this made me laugh harder than it should have .
Happy cakeday to you , too !
That's what I figured , thanks !
You're welcome ! It's a great place to visit if you have time and are willing to spend some time out there .
I don't get it , can someone explain ?
I don't think so , but I'm not familiar enough with keefe to say for sure .
Waluigi doesn't know what he's talking about :P
That would be so much fun to drive around in an open world !
I wouldn't do it , but if you're willing to take that risk then go ahead !
I have no idea , but I'm pretty sure it's from a movie .
Lebron was born and raised in Cleveland though ...
What's the difference ?
I don't think so , he was out of bounds at that point and had to make up for lost yardage with an illegal forward pass .
Contemplating intensifies
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry .
I don't know why you're being down voted , it's not like this is r nba or anything ...
I don't think you know what that word means ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted but I agree with the first two points .
I don't get it . Can someone explain ?
I don't know what you're talking about . I remember him saying that he was going to build a wall and make the Russians pay for it !
Yeah , I'm not sure what they're trying to accomplish by doing that ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's pretty spot on .
I would too , but that's not how it works ...
Agreed , but I don't think either of them should have been on the team in the first place .
I don't think there's anything in the universe that would make me want to be an abernathy so much more than any of those other options .
I'm not sure if you're being serious , but it would be interesting to see how many times each team has had at least one shot go in ...
I don't know about you , but I'm pretty sure that's not going to happen anytime soon .
I don't think I've ever seen a stronger man than him in my life , but that doesn't mean it isn't possible .
I don't think she's going to be in the main roster for a while , sadly .
Me three !
I think it's the same thing that happened to me , but I'm not sure .
Bryant went down with an ankle sprain and he's out for the rest of the game .
I thought so , but I didn't know if it was a different one or not . Thanks !
Awesome , thank you very much :D
I think so , but I could be wrong .
Yeah , but you'd have to live on the other side of the planet from where it's being built ...
Will do , thanks !
That's what they want you to think !
I don't think anyone expected him to step up like that after his performance last week ...
He's not great , but he can't be worse than last year .
I'm sorry for your loss !
It's coarse and gets everywhere !
I don't think so . I'm pretty sure it's the same as last time they played against each other .
I don't think you know what indirectly means ...
Lebron has been doing that for a long time , and it's worked out pretty well so far ...
How much did you end up paying ?
I'd give it an 8.5 , but that's just me .
I don't know why you're being downvoted for asking an honest question ...
You'd be surprised how many people don't even know what that means , let alone where it comes from .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , I thought it was pretty funny !
I don't know why you're being downvoted because that's exactly what it means .
That's what she said !
I hope so too , but I'm not holding my breath ...
It's not about the money , it's about sending a message !
I don't think he's going to be able to pull it off without a lot of help from the studio though .
I don't think he deserves it , but I'm not surprised that the media is trying to make him look worse than he actually is .
As someone who has never been to Singapore , what's so special about it ?
I don't think that's how it works ...

Thank you lt 3
Dogs are people too .

Thanks for the tip , I'll keep that in mind :D
I'm sorry to hear that . Hope you feel better soon !
That's what she said !

That's what she said ?

That's not how it works ...
I don't think it would be a good idea to eat asparagus . It's very high in sugar and can make you sick .

I don't know what that means , but I'll take your word for it !
I don't think I've ever seen a president in my life who didn't have at least one secret service detail following him around all day every day .
That would be the best thing ever !

I don't know why you're being downvoted , I laughed .
I don't think I've ever met a Tigger who didn't want to be referred to as such by their preferred nomenclature .
Reciprocal aid all the way . It's one of my favorite heals in the game , and I'm not even a healer !
Hodgson wasn't that bad tbh but he was a bit overzealous when it came to bringing in players from other teams ...
I don't think so , but I'm not sure why you're being downvoted ...
I don't think they'd be able to tell the difference .
That's the spirit !
I don't think so , but I'm not an expert on this sort of thing .
I'd be okay with this .
I don't think that's how it works .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say with that comment ...
I know , right ? It's so cute !
I was at the game last night and there were a lot of people in my section who didn't want them to win , but they did anyway .
I don't think I've ever met someone who wasn't either of those things .
Portugal . They're my second favorite team and I've been rooting for them since they won it in 2002 .
Don't forget The Revenant !
That's what they tell me !
That's a good way of putting it lol
I'm not talking about the shield op . I'm talking about her being able to jump over walls and stuff like that .
I've seen a lot of people do it , but not sure where they come from or what their reasoning is .
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... it's true !
Thanks for the heads up , I'll keep that in mind !
Thank you for your kind words !
I hope so too , but I don't think they're going to let him fight on short notice for that reason .
That's the one . Thanks !
I don't know why you're being downvoted for speaking the truth . I've never seen this sub as bad as it is right now .
I know , I was just making a joke :P
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is a legitimate point .
I don't think there's a way to make it work on minions . It would have to be coded as an ability or something like that .
I'm not being heartless I just don't think it's a good thing that we're going out of our way to try and make them look better than they are .
Thanks for the offer but it's already been claimed .
I'd say it's a toss up between him and Robson Kanu at this point .

I don't think that's how it works ...
I don't think you know what abuse means ...
I don't know about tolerating , but she's certainly better than what we've had for a while now .
I don't know what that means but I like it .
I don't really like him but he's definitely up there in my top 10 favorite characters for sure !
It's not hate , it's jealousy .
That's not how babies work ...
I'm not even sure what you're trying to say with that one ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is exactly what I would do as well .
Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace Star Wars Episode II : Attack of the Clones star wars episode III : Revenge of the Sith Edit : typo
I didn't , but I've heard good things about them .
Switzerland doesn't even have a military or police force that would be able to defend itself against an attack from outside of its borders .
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... It's a legitimate strategy !
I think that's what he was referring to , yes .
I'm pretty sure that's what they're going to do with Dolores if she doesn't show up in season 2 .

I'd be okay with that !
Firmino is on the bench ...
That's racist .
I haven't been there in a while but it used to be on top of one of the towers that is now gone .

Losses aren't the only thing that matters , but they're certainly one of them .
Porque no los dos ?
I don't think either of those things are true .

I hope you're right , but I don't think it will be that bad of a game for either team .
I don't know why this made me laugh so hard lol
Wouldn't we all ?
I don't know what that has to do with anything ...
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted for pointing out that this isn't true ...
I don't think so but there are a lot of people who believe that they should be able to do whatever they want and get away with it .
It's not that we don't want to win , it's just that there aren't a lot of good teams in Europe right now .

I don't think anyone is saying it isn't good , they're just trying to be edgy .

Same here . I have no idea what they're supposed to look like , or why people use them in the first place .
Probably because it's cheaper and easier to grow .
I'm not sure if you are being serious , but there have been rumors for months now and they still haven't come true .
That's exactly what they want you to think !
Because he didn't touch the ball with his hand , and it wasn't an elbow to the face or anything like that .
I don't know if you're serious , but I'm pretty sure he's joking .
I did , and I don't understand why you're being downvoted for that ...
Hahaha ! That would have been so much funnier if you didn't get downvoted :P
I don't think you know what government means ...
That's what she said ?

I don't know why you're being downvoted ... I'm sure there are plenty of redditors out there who have no idea what they're talking about .
I don't know , but I'm pretty sure he has a lot of money .
I think it's more about the fact that you can't use him as a companion . I don't know why they didn't just put in an AI droid instead .
I don't think I've ever seen anything like that in my entire life .

Deadlifts , cable crunches and barbell rows are my go to .
That's awesome ! I'll have to keep an eye out for them and see if they're still doing it after all these years ...
I don't think it's a plot twist at all , they're just going to do what everyone else has been doing for years and move on with their lives .
I don't know , but I'm pretty sure they're not going to be used for anything .
It's just you .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this ...

That's not what the bible says .
Yeah , I'm not sure why they didn't just go for it on 4th and 1 instead of going for 2 or 3 ...

That's what she said ?
Lockhart ? I hardly knew her !

That's what I'm thinking too , but it would be nice to see them at some point !
I'd be okay with that , but I don't think we'll see her in Legion anytime soon .

I don't know why you're getting downvoted , this is a valid point .
I don't know why you're being downvoted because that's a pretty accurate statement .
Sure , go right ahead !

I like them , but I don't think they're as bad as people make them out to be .

Because you're the only one who's ever used it .
I don't know what to do with my hands !
I don't get it , what's the joke ?
I've been doing that for years ! :D
Because he's rich .
That's what I thought at first as well , but it looked like they were just going for a layup and didn't expect him to be so wide open .

I like your style .
I don't think she would have been able to get out of there if it wasn't for you meddling kids !
I don't know why you're being downvoted this is a pretty accurate statement !
I don't need them , but they do help a lot .

Kimi had a puncture on his front wing , so he was stuck in 3rd for most of the race .

I think he means synonyms .
I don't know , but I hope he doesn't .
I loved that movie , but I felt like the ending was kind of anticlimactic .
Thanks for telling me ! I'll be sure to keep an eye out for more posts like these from now on lt 3
I don't get it , can you explain ?
That's what she said ?
I don't think I've ever heard of such a thing . What was it ?
Varus looks like he just got out of an episode of Family Guy where they're trying to figure out who his dad is .
The wrx is so much more fun to drive than an impreza for sure !
I don't see why not . I'm sure there are plenty of people who would be willing to help with that sort of thing .
I feel better now , thank you !

You're not the only one :D

I don't know why but this made me laugh way more than it should have ...

I don't think that's how it works , but you never know .
Works fine for me . Try again ?

You and me both !

I don't think I've ever had brussel sprouts that weren't cooked in some kind of oil or salt mixture at the very least .
I don't know , but I'm going to go ahead and say it's because of Halloween .
It's not a nerf , it's a buff . It makes his ult more consistent and easier to use than before .
I don't think you know what that word means ...
I don't think there's any character in the game that hasn't had at least one of those phrases by now .
I don't think you understand how contracts work ...
I don't think you know what that word means ...
That's the spirit !
I think it's more of a nerf than a buff :P
Drink up !
He's got a lot of potential . I'm not sure if he'll be able to stay healthy though .
I don't think it's possible to miss out on either of those games , they're both great !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what happened !
I don't think you know what that word means ...
You're welcome :D
I would , but I don't have any money . :P
I don't know why you're being downvoted for pointing out that this picture isn't even close to as big as its supposed to be .
That's what I'm hoping for as well , but we'll have to wait and see !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is exactly how I've dealt with it .
That's what I've been doing with my Wii U so far :D
I don't think it's arguable at this point . SKT and ROX are the only teams that have a chance to win against KT in my opinion .
Purdue has to win their conference tourney . I don't see them making it past the first round at this point .
That's what she said ?
That's the spirit !
I thought it looked familiar ! I used to live in the same town as you when I was growing up and this is one of my favorite places ever .
That's what they want you to think !
Zapdos is gone , sorry !
Forest , because I don't have to worry about the weather .
It's one of the best animes out there , you should watch it .
I don't know why you're getting downvoted ... I thought it was pretty funny !
I think that's what they're trying to get you to do !
I don't think he's going to come back for another movie but I could totally see him playing the same character from TDKR or something like that .
I mean , they're not wrong ...
That's a good point , I hadn't thought of that !
I didn't even notice that until you pointed it out ! That's pretty impressive for someone who doesn't really know what they're doing .
Because it's the offseason and we're bored .
Very carefully .
That's the spirit !
He looks so much younger than he did in the first movie and I'm really excited for him to be back as an older character .
Haha , good luck ! I'm sure it'll work out just as well or better than mine did :P
Yeah , I don't know why people are downvoting you for having a different opinion than everyone else ...
I think he's the best part of this season so far !
I don't think you know what invasion means ...
It's been happening to me for a while now , but I haven't had any problems yet .
You must not have been paying attention to the pre show ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is exactly what I thought when I read the article .
Drugs are bad mkay !
Croatia has one of the best teams in Europe right now though ...
I'll be on in a few minutes !
I don't know why you're being downvoted but I agree with your sentiment .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is spot on !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is exactly what Trump has been doing since the beginning of his presidency .
I don't think I've ever been so happy to be wrong !
I don't think you understand how Facebook works ...
I'd rather not .
Sweden is one of the most beautiful countries i've ever been too !
I'd buy that for a dollar !
Astronomy , I believe .
Uruguay are a good team , but I don't think they'll be able to keep up with Italy and Spain in their current form .
I don't think they're that bad , but it depends on what kind of work you want to do there .
I don't know why you're being downvoted because that is exactly what happened ...
Yeah , that's what I was thinking as well . The HRE didn't really have much of a presence in Europe until late into the 19th and early 20th centuries .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's true !
I don't think so , but I'm not sure . It's been a while since I've looked into it .
I don't know why you're getting downvoted for having an issue with your xbox live account not being able to be used on the PS4 ...
I don't know why but this made me laugh harder than it should have .
I don't like him , but I'm not going to downvote you for that .
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic . Either way it's brilliant !
I don't know why you're being downvoted but it's true . Rats are very territorial and will attack anyone who tries to mess with them .
If you don't care about exclusives then yes . If you want to play them on PS4 or XB1 that's another story though .
That's what I was thinking , but it doesn't seem like that would be a good idea .
I'm sorry ! I didn't know there was a rule against that kind of thing on this subreddit : s
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... it's just a fact of life :P
Thank you ! It's my first time doing anything like this so I'm really excited to see how it turns out :D
I don't know why you're being downvoted for having an opinion that differs from your own .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what happened .
That would be really cool , but I don't think it'll happen for a long time :P
That's a good way to do it , but if you don't have any other media player that works well in the background then why bother ?
What's your favorite color ?
I don't know , I'm pretty sure that's what they were going for ...
I don't think I've ever heard him say something like that , but maybe it's just me ...
That's what she said ?
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... I thought it was pretty funny !
I don't think that's how it works ...
That's the spirit !
That's what I thought at first , but it doesn't have the same ring to it ...
I don't think you know what grinch means ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... I've seen a lot of people complain about how they can't bring their car with them when traveling abroad .
I don't know if you're being serious or not but there was an episode of Futurama where they were trying to figure out what happened during that time period .
He was on the Jets for a few years before he got drafted by the Eagles , so you're not far off !
I don't know , but I'm going to try it out and report back !
I don't think he's the type of director who'd want to work with him on something like that though ...
That's what she said .
I don't think you understand what I'm trying to say ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , but I'm pretty sure that was his point .
It's because they don't want to be associated with a German team in the same way as Mercedes , Ferrari or Mclaren do .
I don't know why this made me laugh as hard as it did ...
That's what she said !
I don't think it would be too bad if you could create your own server and just play on that one .
Thank you ! He's one of the best horses I've ever had :D
Haha same here ! I was just about to ask if anyone else had this problem and they did not have an Emergency Alert for me :P
I'll take that as a compliment !
I don't think that's how it works ...
I don't think I've ever heard of the Strokes . What kind of music do they play ?
I don't know what's going on but I love it !
Suarez is one of the best players in the world and deserves to play for his country even more than CR7 does .
That's what she said !
I don't even know what that means .
They can't . They're not allowed to take photos of their own species or anything like that .
Then you are lost !
That's what I thought at first too , but he didn't seem to have any problems in scrims or anything like that .
I'll give it a try thanks !
A miserable pile of secrets !
Haha , that's awesome ! I'm going to have to use that one from now on :D
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that was a pretty big mistake on his part .
Yeah , it's been a long time since the 90s .
I used to play it all the time as a kid ! It was my favorite tower defense game back in the day .
I don't think he'd be able to do it on his own , but you never know !
I don't have a facebook , but thanks for the advice !
Fortnite is a great game , you should give it a try !
What do you think of him as a host ? Do you enjoy his stand up or not ?
It's just a prank bro !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , but I agree with all of your points .
I'd vote for her !
That's what I was wondering . It looks like it could have been used for something else , but you can never be too sure !
It's because of the way you sit on them , not how they're made .
Braum has been around for quite some time , he's just not very good right now .
I don't think you know what an excuse is .
I don't think that's how it works ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is an excellent point .
Nah he's going to build a wall and make them pay for it .
I'm pretty sure that's what happened , but I don't know enough about this stuff to say for certain .
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... I think it's pretty obvious that this is sarcasm ..
I don't think it's that much of an issue as long as you use the same color for both cans and bottles .
Sounds like a lot of fun ! Where are you moving from ?
C9 has a better chance of beating tsm than any other team in NA right now and they're not even close to being top 3 atm ...
That's what I thought at first too but they're definitely not shopped !
I don't know , but I'm pretty sure it's the same on both platforms .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but this is the first time I've ever heard of it .
I don't know , but I'm pretty sure they have a better record than us .
I don't think I've ever been so excited for a game in my life .
Pepperidge Farm remembers .
In n Out is my favorite fast food chain by a long shot ... so much better than McDonalds or Burger King !
I think so , yes .
I don't get it , can you explain ?
I was thinking the exact same thing . I hope so !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what it looks like ...
Why are you here ?
That's not what I said , but okay .
That's a good way to put it !
I don't know , but I want to see it now .
I don't think you know what swimming is ...
That's not a bad idea , but I don't think they'll be able to handle that many people at once .
I'm sure you can find them at the grocery store !
Don't worry , we're all here for you lt 3
Yeah , he's got some of the best cardio in MMA right now !
That's not even his final form .
I don't know what to do with my hands !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's one of my all time favorite games !
Big if true
I don't know why you're being downvoted when it's true ...
I've seen a lot of people wear them but they're definitely not for everyone !
Not sure why you're being downvoted ... I'd like to know this as well !
I don't like it either , but that's just my personal preference . I'm sure there are other people out there who do too !
This is the best idea I've heard so far !
That's what I've been doing for years , works great !
Ssumday isn't a top laner , but he's definitely up there in terms of being one of the best western mids IMO .
There's a lot more than just muslims , but I'm not sure where you're getting that from ?
Because he's hungry .
I don't think that's how it works ...
That's what I'm hoping for as well !
Happy Birthday !
You'll be fine . It's not like you're going to get stabbed or anything .
I don't think that's how it works ...
Thanks for clearing that up !
Did you break your foot ?
I don't think I've ever been able to beat it . It's just too much for me at this point .
I don't think there's a single player in the world who can do what he does and still be able to make it look so good .
I can't believe you've done this !
I've seen it happen , but I don't know how many people have done it or if they were able to do it successfully .
That's exactly what I'm thinking right now !
Wakanda is one of the best places he's ever been for sure !
I don't think he deserved to be sent off , but that's just my opinion and I'm not a ref .
I was thinking the same thing . I don't think you'd be able to get out of there with that much weight on your back .
I don't think it's possible for either of those teams to score more than 2 goals .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what I was thinking !
I didn't even know that was a thing , but it makes me feel so much better !
I think you're on to something ...
DONE.BACK TO ME
That's what I'm hoping for !
Firmino for me as well . I think he's the best player in the league right now !
You have to score more goals than your opponent if you want any chance of winning a game .
I don't think so . I've only ever seen them do that when there's a lot of traffic at once .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is exactly how it was described in the article .
FSU's offense has been atrocious for the past few weeks , but they're still a top 25 team . I'd say their defense is pretty solid though .
That's not a bad idea at all !
I'm not American , but I've lived in the US my whole life and have never heard of this .
I don't know what this means , but I'm upvoting it anyway because of your username .
I don't think he's been picked in any of the tourneys so far , but it would be nice to see him at some point !
I don't think it was a bad call at all , but I'm not sure why they didn't go for two on 4th and 1 from there .
I know right ? I can't even imagine what it must have felt like .
That's what she said .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , I thought it was funny !
I think so , but I'm not 100 sure .
I don't know what this means but I like it .
That's not how insurance works ...
Interesting , thanks for sharing !
Warren by a mile .
I thought it looked like him too !
I haven't played the game yet but from what I've heard its pretty fun so far !
I don't think you know what that word means .
I don't think I've ever met someone who didn't have at least one of those two things in common .
I don't think you know what reformed means .
I think it's more of a case of him not having the arm strength to be able to make an accurate throw at all .
Don't forget Puerto Rico !
I think you're right , but I don't want to get my hopes up ...
I don't think so . There are a lot of songs I'd rather vote for than this one .
I'd buy that for a dollar !
I woke up at 4:30 am and slept for about an hour . I'm not sure if that's enough time , though .
I've heard good things about Hyperion , thanks !
That's the spirit !
That's what she said !
I don't think I've ever seen him miss more than 2 FGs in his career .
I don't know what that means , but I'll take your word for it !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what I was thinking when I read your edit .
I knew he looked familiar !
It's been that way for years .
I think it's a reference to an episode of South Park .
You're not alone , I don't either !
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted for asking a legitimate question ...
Lonzo is a good shooter , he just doesn't seem to be able to hit his open 3 ' s at an NBA level .
I don't think that's how it works ...
I've seen a lot of people wearing them in the last few weeks , so it's definitely possible !
I don't know . I've never been to a state that doesn't have at least one or two different types of pizza , so it's hard for me to say .
That's what I was going for :D
I'm not saying he isn't good at it ... I just don't think there's much of a difference between him and Messi when it comes to goal scoring ability ..
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but I don't get it ...
You can already do this by making it so you don't get more than two channels at any given time .
I don't know why you're being downvoted for your opinion but I think this is a very valid point .
I don't think he was being serious ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... this is a valid point .
I don't think you'll be able to use it in a lot of places where touch id isn't an option .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but 1.79 v is still a lot of power for such a small device .
It's a lot better than the first one , but not as good as BO1 or Bo2 IMO .
I don't know why you are being downvoted ... this is a valid point .
You and me both !
I know , right ? I'm not sure what to do with my hands now ...
That's a great idea , thanks !
thank mr zven
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... I'm pretty sure he wouldn't be able to tell the difference if it wasn't for those patches .
Me too thanks
I don't think the Switch will be able to handle 1080p 60fps without some kind of input lag or something like that .
I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that they'd rather play against the Patriots than the Giants ...
I thought the same thing at first , but then I realized that it's probably just a picture of him sitting down and taking a sip ...
I'm not hating , I just don't think it's fair to give the MVP to a guy who didn't even play that much last year .
RemindMe ! 2 years
I'd be okay with that , but I don't think we can afford him at this point in his career .
I don't think it would be too much of a stretch for Paladins to make an appearance in Legion as well .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I don't think that's what they were protesting about ...
That's what I'm thinking as well , but we'll see !
You're hired !
No , I'm telling you he's a handsome man .
That's what I'm hoping for !
Westlake Villager here , can confirm it's westlake village !
I don't think there's going to be much of a difference in color , but if you're worried about that then go ahead and pick one up !
You can get it at most grocery stores , but I don't know if they're sold in the U . S . or not .
That's what they want you to think ...
I've been using it for a long time and I still don't know how to use it : c
I don't think you know what that word means ...
I've done that before and it was a lot of fun , but I don't want to do it again !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , but yours is pretty good !
Yeah , that's what I was going to say . It looks so out of place and doesn't really fit with the rest of the animation .
I don't think he's going to be as good next year , but we'll see what happens this offseason .
I don't know why you're being downvoted . This sub is full of children who have no idea what they are talking about .
EA by a mile .
I don't think I've ever been so happy to be wrong about something !
He didn't play bad , but he wasn't the best player on that team by any means .
That's what I was going to say ! He looks like he is about to jump out of a window or something , and then his face lights up when you look at him .
That's the spirit !
That's not how betting works ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted because that's exactly what happened .
You should probably get that checked out .
If you're a wrestling fan , prepare to have your heart broken by the end of this match .
I don't know , but I'd like to see him get a few more snaps this year before he retires .
Because he hasn't been able to get the ball out of his hands for a while now ...
Nope , I'm with you on this one . Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad are my two favorite shows of all time .
Where do you live ? I've never seen one for less than 100 in my life !
That's awesome ! How long did it take for you to get there ?
Purdue is playing a lot better than they did last year , but it's still early in the season so we'll have to see how that plays out .
I don't know why I'm getting downvoted for this ... it's true !
I don't think that's what he was expecting .
I don't think that's how it works ...
I don't think you know what legal means ...
I don't think that's the case for me because I haven't gotten any PMs about my ban at all ...
I don't think you know what practice is ...
That's what I've always heard as well . Thanks !
That's the spirit !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's true ...
It's a skillshot , you just have to know how to use it correctly and the timing is pretty good .
I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing ...
I'm not sure what you're trying to get at with this comment . I don't think there's anything wrong with being happy for someone who wants to do good things .
Brussel sprouts are so much better than Brussel Sprouts ... I can't even eat them without thinking about how delicious they are .
Starring Rob Schneider .
Thank you so much ! That means a lot to me lt 3
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... I think it's pretty safe to say that all three are going to be in this tournament .
I'm pretty sure that's a man in his early 20 ' s , but you're probably right .
That would have been a great title for the movie !
That's what I was thinking too . They're not going to be able to do that on their own , are they ?
I don't think you know what that word means .
This is why we can't have nice things !
Don't let your dreams be dreams !
I don't know , but I'm not going to ask .
I don't know why you're being downvoted for expressing your opinion on a video game ...
I don't think so , but I could be wrong on that one .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what happened to me !
It's coming to Xbox One and PS4 , but I'm not sure about the PC version yet .
I don't think there's a single person who doesn't want an Avatar movie at some point in the future .
That's what she said !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but that's exactly what it says in the article ...
Ahh okay cool . Thanks for letting me know , and congrats on your first win !
Don't forget us !
Same here . It's nice to be able to put music on my phone and not have to worry about CDs anymore !
This guy gets it .
I don't think so , but I could be wrong . :P
That's exactly what I was thinking . If you don't want to play the game why are you spending money on it ?
I don't know , but I'm sure it would be a lot of fun !
I don't know about that , but I'll take it !
I don't think so , but we'll see what happens in the future !
What does it mean ?
I don't know about you , but I've been using Lyft for years and never had an issue .
Don't worry , you'll be able to wear them again next year !
I don't think he was going that fast , but I could be wrong .
I'm not saying they weren't , it's just that no one really knows what to expect from their respective teams these days .
I don't think that's what he was saying ...
I've been doing this for about 3 years now with no issues . It's really easy to do if you know what you're doing .
Don't worry , you won't be the only one !
That's a good point , I didn't even think about that !
I don't even know what that means .
I thought Pacific Rim was the best movie of all time and that's saying a lot coming from someone who doesn't like action movies .
That's a good question . I don't know enough about it to give an informed opinion on that though .
I don't think he's talking about the movie , but in real life .
I was thinking more along the lines of people who are already dead but don't want to go through all that paperwork again .
I haven't seen anything about that yet . I'm sure it'll be fixed soon , though .
I wouldn't even be mad .
I don't think I've ever seen a human being look more like an animal than she does in this picture .
I haven't but I've heard good things about it !
Thanks for pointing that out , I fixed it !
Because he's faster .
Yes , yes you are : 3
I'm not your dad , son !
I've never been there , so I don't know what to tell you :P
I don't know why you're being downvoted because this is exactly what it sounds like .
Adblock Plus ?
I don't think that's how it works , but I could be wrong .
That's what she said .
I don't think I've ever had a worse day in my life than today .
Oblivion is a lot more fun than it used to be :D
That's a lot of touchdowns .
That's what I figured , thanks !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's an interesting point of view !
Because he's a terrible host ?

I hope so !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what I was going to say !
This is what happens when you don't take your meds for a few days after an election .
I don't think you know what that word means ...
That's what I was thinking too , but it seems like a lot of people don't think that way !
I don't think that's how it works , but thanks for trying !
Fury is one of the most exciting fighters to watch , but I don't think he should be on this list ...
Nope , it's a Wii U exclusive .
That's what I was thinking , he looks so happy !
I don't know if I should laugh or cry .
Horizon is one of the best games I've ever played , you won't be disappointed !
It's been raining for a few days now , but I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it .
I don't think you know what Wildcard means ...
I'd like one as well please !
I don't know about you but I'm pretty sure that's not a human .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but I'll take your word for it .
I don't know why you're being downvoted for having an opinion that differs from the majority of people who play this game .
I don't know why you're being downvoted . This is exactly what I was going to say .
Same here , but it's nice to be able to play with friends .
I'd take that trade in a heartbeat lol
I don't think I've ever seen a player who wasn't good at every single one of those ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , I thought it was pretty funny !
I don't see why they wouldn't release a remastered version of RDR on Xbox One and PS4 at some point in the future .
I'm pretty sure he was referring to the fact that no one has ever been able to survive an actual fall of 30,000 ft without some sort of injury .
That's what I was thinking . Looks just like it !
That's what I was thinking too !
That's what she said !
I don't think I've ever watched an NBA game in my life . It's just a bunch of guys sitting around talking about how much better they are than everyone else .
I've never had halo top , so I can't comment on it . Sorry !
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... I'm with you on this one !
I've listened to a few songs on there and they're all great ! I'm looking forward to the next album as well :D
You won't be able to see the ban message , but you will know that your account has been deleted .
I don't think you know what that word means .
176,354 I don't know what to do with my hands !
I don't think that's how it works , but I could be wrong .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is a very valid point .
Flacco isn't even the best QB on his own team . I don't know what you're talking about .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote ...
I don't think I've ever heard of someone getting annoyed by that many jokes .
Can you pm me too ? Thanks !
Little Caesars is better than Papa Johns though .
I'll give that a try when I get home from work ! Thank you so much :D
That's what I was thinking too , but she doesn't seem to have any collarbones or anything that would make it difficult for me to do so .
I was just about to say the same thing ! They were so much more comfortable back then ...

That's what I'm planning on doing as soon as it comes out !

I'm pretty sure you can get away with anything if you're willing to risk your life in order to do so .
I don't think I've ever heard of that show , is it any good ?
I'm pretty sure that's the point of this post ...
Worley isn't very good , but I think he's going to be one of the best corners in the league next year .

I can't tell if you're serious ...
I don't know why but this made me laugh way more than it should have ...
I do it too , but I don't know if that's a good or bad thing ...

I'm pretty sure that's the correct way to say it !
What's your favorite color ?
I hope so . He's a great player , but I don't want to see him on the bench for long periods of time .
That's the spirit !
I don't think so . You'll have to wait a little while longer ...
It's treason then ...
I don't know of any but you could try to find one and see if it works for you .
I don't even know what that means , but I'll take your word for it .

That's what she said .
Don't forget to turn off your wifi !
He's not bad , but he has a lot of room to grow . I think his ceiling is much higher than people give him credit for .
If you have an Android phone , there are plenty of apps that do the same thing !
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... it's not like there are any other centers on the market right now who aren't going to make anywhere near as much money .
I don't think you know what that word means .

Yeah , that's what I meant :P
It's a reference to an episode of South Park , I believe .

That sounds like an awesome job :D
I don't know why you're being downvoted for asking an honest question ...
That's what I'm thinking as well , but we'll see !
That's awesome ! I'm sure you'll be able to come up with something better than that , but it sounds like the best option right now .
Because it's convenient for people who don't live in the city and want to be able to park wherever they want without having to worry about being towed .
You can't cross if you don't have possession of the ball when your feet are on the ground lol
I was going to say John Turturro , but that works too !
I don't think he'll be able to hold onto the ball for more than 5 yards , though .
I'm not sure what you're talking about . My cat's eyes have always looked blue to me .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote you ...
That would be a dream come true .
I can't wait to see what they do with him , he was my favorite part of that movie and his character is one of mine as well .

I don't think that's what he meant .
That's what she said ?
I'm rooting for you guys so hard right now !
I don't think I've ever been so excited for a movie in my life !

Can confirm . I caught a Dratini on my way home from work this morning !
I don't know what you're talking about . I've never heard of such a thing ...
That's the spirit !
Burritos all the way . I don't care what anyone says !
Feels good to be back in the playoffs !
I don't know why you're being downvoted because this is 100 true .
That's what she said ?
Why can't it be both ?
I think it was a bit of both . Seoul is playing really well , but they're just not doing anything right now .
That would be a dream come true !
I don't know , but it's probably less than a pound .
Nah , just wait a few days and you should be fine .
That's what I'm leaning towards as well ! Thanks for the input !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's a valid point .

I don't think so , but I'm not sure if there's a way to find out !
Was she hot ?
I don't understand why you're being downvoted , this is true .
Not with that attitude !
Sure thing ! PM me your address :D

I'm sorry for your loss .
It looks like a wig to me .
I've only had them for a few months , but from what I can tell the quality is pretty good and it's not too expensive either .
Jason Momoa is my favorite actor of all time , and the only reason I haven't given up on him yet !
That's what I thought at first too , but it looks like they're not wearing any shoes .
Happy Birthday !
What's your job ?
I don't think that's how it works ...
I don't even know what to do with my life right now ...

That's what she said !
Sylvanas didn't get nerfed at all . She was buffed , but she wasn't touched in any significant way .
That's what she said ?
TSM fan here , I don't think he deserves it . He's not even a top 3 mid laner in NA right now .
He's a master of karate and friendship for everyone !
I don't know but I'm sure there's a way to do it if you try hard enough .
I don't think they're going to decriminalize anything that isn't already legal for personal use and possession of less than an ounce .
You can get it for free on amazon.co.uk if you have a prime account .
I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life while playing League of Legends !
I don't think I've ever seen a spaniard who didn't like doraemon ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted this is exactly how we've been playing the last couple of weeks .
I don't think it's that he has a job , I think people are just tired of hearing about him and not actually watching the games .
I think he's trying to get him into the main event .
I don't know what that means , but it sounds delicious !
Same here . I don't really care about any of that stuff and it doesn't bother me at all .
I don't know , I've seen a lot of people do this in the past . It's not hard at all !
I don't know why you're getting downvoted because this is pretty much exactly what happened with Giroud during his time at Arsenal .
It's not that you're bad , it's your playstyle . You should be able to beat most of them without using any special moves at all .
That's what I love about it too ! :D
Yeah , I don't know why people are downvoting you for having an opinion that differs from their own .
I don't know what you're talking about , but I'm going to go out on a limb here and say there's no such thing as an unlimited supply of snacks .
I don't know . How long have you been pregnant ?
I'll give it a shot ! :D
That's what happens when you don't eat enough potatoes !
I don't know , but I'm not going to tell you .
It's on Netflix , but you have to be a season or two behind if you want to catch up !
I don't know why you're being downvoted for pointing out that it doesn't look like anything to do with Germany at all .

I don't think I've ever met a person who didn't have an irrational hatred of Sherman in their life .
I don't know ... maybe you're just really into that sort of thing :P
Sounds like a plan !
I'm not sure what you're trying to get at with your question but the answer is probably yes .

I don't think you know what that means ...
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted ... it's an honest question !
I don't think that's how it works ...
It's not even a celebration , it's an act of defiance !
I can't wait to see what he does next !
I think it's supposed to be the other way around , but I could be wrong .
I was thinking the exact same thing . They didn't seem to have much in common , but I guess that's what makes them so distinctive .
I don't like him at all , but that doesn't mean he shouldn't be in this movie .
I don't think he's ever played there before , but I wouldn't mind seeing him on the bench for a game or two at least .
I've had that happen to me a few times as well ! It's so annoying when you're trying to leave the house and it doesn't work ...
It's a lot of fun , you should give it a try !

I don't know what you're talking about , but I'm pretty sure it's a joke .
I don't know why you're being downvoted this is a great quote !
I don't think so . I'm pretty sure it's because they didn't want to spend money on a game that wasn't even out yet .

I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is the correct answer .

I don't think I've ever been so happy to be wrong !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's pretty funny !
I don't know why this made me laugh so hard !

It's been a while since we've seen him , but he doesn't seem like much of a threat at all .
I think it's more that he didn't know what to do with his ulti . He had no idea if they were going to engage or not .

Keep going ! You can do it !
That's what she said !
Shrek 2 was the best movie of all time !
I didn't even think about it until they asked me if I wanted to take one of their drugs , lol .

I see what you did thar !

That's what she said !

I've done that before . It's not fun , but you get used to it after a while .
It's just a prank bro !

I don't know why but this made me laugh more than it should have .

I don't think they can fire him . He's still under contract and has a year left on his deal .
Me too ! :D
I don't know why you're being downvoted when it's the exact opposite of what he said .
It's an old one , but it checks out !
It is if you live in a state that doesn't have any laws against it .
I'll check it out thanks !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's a pretty stupid thing to say ...
That's the spirit !
I'm not sure if this is sarcasm or not ...
I don't know , I'm not a doctor .
I don't know if you're being serious or not , but Rocket Power is actually a pretty good show !
Kroos is a great player , but he's not in the best form of his life right now . I don't think we'll see him again this season .
That's not what he said at all ...
Aerodynamics are a big part of F1 ' s appeal IMO . It's not like they're trying to make it more aerodynamic or anything ...
I don't think that's the case in LOTR though ...
I don't know why , but that was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen !
That's what I've been doing for the past couple of days . :P
They're legal in California as long as you don't exceed a certain number of treads per tire .

He's a pretty big name in the music industry and has been touring quite a bit since his album came out .
Don't worry , it's just a prank bro !
That's what she said .
That's a good way of putting it !
That's what she said .
I'm pretty sure that's not how it works at all .
Don't worry , I'm sure he'll get the job done for you !
Rikara has been doing really well lately . I think it's just because they're trying to get her over as much as possible .
I'm pretty sure that's what they were going for , but I don't know if it was intentional or not .
I don't know why but this made me laugh more than it should have .
Yes , yes we are .
That's what I was thinking lol
That's what she said ?
How much did you make ?
Omlette du fromage ?
Don't forget Magnolia !
I've never seen one in my life , but I'm sure there are a lot of us out there !
I don't think this is true , but I could be wrong .
Pobelter would be Kakashi if he were to become a full time member of the Kage Bunshin no Jutsu clan .
Thanks for letting us know ! We'll be looking into this as soon as we get more information on what's going on .
I don't think that's how it works ...
Smackdown is the best show on TV right now and it's only getting better !
I've never seen one of those before , but it looks like they're all over the place these days ...
I don't think that's how it works ...
Tetris is one of my all time favorite games ! It's a shame that it doesn't get any love on this sub ...
I'm not sure what you're trying to say with that last sentence but it doesn't make any sense ...
Polar bears can't be depressed , they're just happy to see you .
I was thinking the same thing ! I think it's just because they're wearing a lot of clothes that make them look younger .
I don't think you know what that word means ...
I don't think you know what that word means ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's a pretty good take .
I don't think so , but I could be wrong .
I can't tell if you're being serious or not ...
Jail ? I hardly knew her !
Because he's a good defender ?
I don't think that's how it works ...
You are not alone .
I wish ! But I'm not :P
You have been banned from r Pyongyang
I don't know anything about that but I'm sure you can find out !
That's what she said .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is exactly what the article says .
Hair ties don't last long enough for me to be able to pull them off at that time of day !
I don't know , but I'm pretty sure that's illegal .
I'm pretty sure that's what he said .
I don't think I could have done it without the help of a friend who is very good at photoshop and was able to give me some tips .
He's from the Netherlands , yes .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what happened with coke back in the day .
I don t get it , can someone explain ?
It's a lot of fun if you're into that sort of thing !
I don't know why you're being downvoted when it's true ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is exactly what I'm thinking !
I think you're thinking of Batman Begins , which takes place during the same time period as TDKR .
I don't think he's ever played a game in his life where he didn't get fouled on an attempt to dribble or pass it out of bounds .
I was thinking more along the lines of The Shining , but that works too !
Greg chun is one of my all time favorite characters so it would be cool to have him as an announcer for this game :D
I don't think you know what being an adult means .
I don't know what she's doing with her vegetables , but they're delicious !
You can't go wrong with either of them , but if you're looking for something that tastes good and is reasonably priced I'd recommend the red velvet one .
If you're not having fun then why are you here ?
Lonzo is a better passer and shooter than Rondo but I don't think he'll have as much of an impact on defense like Rondo did .
I'm not sure what you mean by that , but I agree with your sentiment .
Whoever scores more goals .
I don't mind him as long as he doesn't bring it up every 5 minutes or so .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but I'll take your word for it .
That's the spirit !
That's the spirit !
I don't think you understand how long it's been since we've had an offensive coordinator that actually knows what he's doing .
That's what they want you to think !
D:
That's the spirit !
I don't know about you , but I love the way they look .
I don't think I've ever seen so many people on r nfl complain about refs before , and it's only been one game ...
It's a joke , calm down .
The same people who pay for everything else , right ?
You don't have to be a good player to know how to deal with an immobile mage that can one shot you from far away .
I'd like to see him wear it for a game or two , but that's just me .
I'm not saying they shouldn't be able to do whatever they want as long as it doesn't interfere with my enjoyment of the game .
I don't think so , but I'm not an expert on that matter .
Because he was fouled on the way up ?
That's what I figured . Thanks !
That's exactly what I was thinking when I read your comment !
You are not alone , brother .
That's what she said .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is a very real possibility .
Don't worry , we'll be able to trade them all away in a few years !
I'm not sure what you're trying to say with that last sentence ...
Happy Birthday !
Yeah , but I don't think he would have been able to pull that off without some kind of special effects .
I don't think that's how it works ...
I don't think you know what average means ...
Swedish is the official language of Canada and a lot of people speak it as their first language if they don't have one already .
I thought the same exact thing . He didn't even have enough time to get out of his ulti before it hit him .
He's the only one I've ever seen with dreads and they're not even close to being as bad as some of the other players in our secondary .
That's what she said ?
I don't know if that's a good thing or not , but thanks !
I hope so , it's a great story !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what happened to me !
I don't know why but this made me laugh so hard :D
I can't wait for the World Cup . It's gonna be great !
Hereford isn't in the North , it's a suburb of London .
That's what I thought at first as well , but it looks like they were just trying to get him out of the way and didn't really think that far ahead .
Haha , that would have been a good one too !
That's what I'm waiting for !
I don't think I've ever seen a team play so poorly in such a short amount of time that they couldn't come back and win it all .
I got one last night and it was my first Nat 5 pull of the year :D
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted , this is a legitimate question !
What is love ?
I've been meaning to check that out , thanks !
I don't know why but this made me laugh way more than it should have ...
I don't think that's how it works ...
I don't think so , but I'm not a minivan driver .
Haha , that's what I'm talking about ! :D
I don't think you understand how contracts work ...
What kind of burrito ? I want one !
What was her name ?
You mean like the USSR ?
I don't think so , but I wouldn't be surprised if we see a lot more of them next year .
It's not over yet , we still have a long way to go ...
I don't see why he wouldn't . It's not like they're going to fire him after this season anyway .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but I don't think it makes sense ...
What do you mean ? It looks fine to me ...
That's what she said !
I don't think you know what Kibosh means ...
La Liga MX is a great league , you should check it out !
That's what I thought at first , but you can't see his face very well from this angle .
It's treason then .
That would be a dream come true !
I'm not sure , but it seems to me that they're trying to get rid of him .
I'm pretty sure that's when he first started using them as an insult against people who didn't like him back then .
I'm not sure what you're getting at , but I'll take your word for it .
I don't think there was a lot to do in those movies but I'm pretty sure that's what you're referring to .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , there's a lot of stuff in KH3 that we haven't seen yet .
You're a good man .
I was thinking the same thing , but I'm not sure if that's what they were going for ...
I don't see why not . He's a Muslim , after all .
That's what I was going to say , but it doesn't look like he has that kind of money right now .
I don't think that's what he was trying to say ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is the right answer .
That's what she said ?
That's what I'm going to do , thanks for the advice !
Clyde's is closed on Sundays .
Smash Scramble !
I don't think it's fair to judge a player based on one game , especially when they've been playing well for so long .
I'm not sure , but I don't see why you wouldn't be able to do that .
That's not how it works in the US ...
I've never seen a beagle do that before , but I'll take your word for it !
That's what I was thinking , but she doesn't seem to have a lot of meat in her diet so it wouldn't surprise me if that wasn't the case .
That's what I've been doing for a few weeks now and haven't had any problems at all !
He's on IR with an ankle sprain so they're probably going to put him back in at some point during the 4th or 5th quarter if it doesn't get better .
We don't , but that doesn't stop us from having a lot of them .
I think that's what they call it in the NBA , but I could be wrong .
What did they say ?
That's what she said ?
I don't think that's how it works ...
That's what happens when you don't pay your taxes !
I was thinking the exact same thing . There's so much that could be said about this story but no one seems to want to talk about it .
Nah he didn't say anything . He was just talking about how the refs have been calling a lot of ticky tack fouls on him this game .
That's the spirit !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not but there is a movie coming out this year that takes place during his time as Spider Man .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , I thought the same thing at first too .
That's what I thought at first , but he wasn't in any of the trailers .
That's what she said !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's the truth .
It's a trap !
You're right , I didn't even notice it was in Cali !
I don't think that's how it works ...
I'd say so . He's got the tools to be an above average corner , which is what we need right now .
I don't think that's how it works ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted for pointing out an obvious fact ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted because that's exactly what happened .
I don't think you know what that word means ...
That would make a lot more sense !
I don't know if that's a good thing or not ...
Marcelo wasn't even on the team sheet , so I don't know what you're talking about .
Zombie Island is one of those movies that makes me want to watch it again just for nostalgia's sake .
I didn't know either until someone pointed it out to me the other day !
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but it sounds delicious !
Lebron isn't even close to being a top 3 player in the league . I don't know what you're talking about .
I m sorry for your loss !
I don't know if you're being sarcastic or not but that's exactly what happened lol
I don't get it . What's going on ?
That's a great idea . Thanks !
I'm in the same boat as you . Can't wait to see Infinity War , but it's going to be a long wait ...
I don't think I've ever had one of those pizzas , but it sounds delicious !
That's a pretty good reason to be honest with yourself !
Because you're subscribed to r showerthoughts .
Doesn't say anything about how much money he has in his bank account , though .
I don't think it does , but that's just my opinion . It doesn't make sense for him to be so highly rated after only one year in the league .
It's a good movie , but I don't think it has anything to do with Battle Royale .
I don't know why , but this made me laugh harder than it should have .
I'd buy that for a dollar !
I don't think it's a good idea to use the term'building inspector'when referring to someone who doesn't know what they're talking about .
That's what I was thinking , but it would be hard to find them if they were in their 50s or 60s ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's true . Direct democracy isn't always the best way to go about things .
I don't think he'll make it . He's not good enough for that kind of pressure .
That's the spirit !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , I'm with you on this one .
Pluto is the only planet that matters !
I don't see why they wouldn't do that . They already have a bunch of games coming out this year , and Overwatch is one of them .
I think it's a combination of both , but I can see where you're coming from .
I don't know why you're being downvoted for having an opinion that differs from the majority of people who voted for him .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , he's not even close to a top tier player at this point in time .
It's going to be an hour and a half long , so you'll have plenty of time .
I don't think you know what that word means ...
Not yet , but they're working on it .
Thanks ! I'm glad you enjoyed it .
I don't know why you're being downvoted because that is exactly what I was thinking !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I'll take your word for it .
I'm sure you can find them on ebay or amazon for a decent price !
I don't think that's how religion works ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted because that's exactly what happened lol
Tellius is one of my favorites as well :D
That's the spirit !
Reggie pls .
Corgis are the most popular breed of dog in Japan , so it makes sense to name them after something they eat .
Scorsese is one of my favorite directors , you should definitely check him out !
Squab has been around since at least the early 20th century and isn't even close to Gamey Chicken !
I don't think you know what that word means .
I don't think I've ever seen an Astra that didn't flop at least once .
I don't think I've ever hated a team more than we do at this point in the season .
I don't think you know what that word means ...
That's good to hear , thanks !
I don't think you understand the concept of sarcasm ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted because it's true and I'm not going to waste my time trying to convince people otherwise .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , Samuro is a really fun hero to play !
Papal Ivory ? I've never seen that before . Is it a rare color or something ?
I'm not sure if you're being serious , but I think it was supposed to be the other way around ...
I don't think that's how it works ...
Because you want to be able to use it for a long period of time without worrying about your phone overheating and dying !
Ah ok , I was thinking more along the lines of a little further north than that :P
I don't think I've ever seen one of these in my life , and it's only been two years since they were first released .
Cottage cheese is my go to when I don't feel like going out and getting something else !
That's what I was thinking too , but it doesn't seem to match up with any of his other tattoos ...
Is she single ?
I don't know if you're being serious or not but I'm pretty sure there are a lot of QBs in this draft class that aren't going to pan out .
Haha , I didn't even notice that until you pointed it out !
I don't think I've ever heard anyone say he was a good president , but that doesn't stop people from voting for him .
Flair up !
I don't think I've ever been so happy to be wrong .
I don't know why , but this made me laugh harder than it should have .
He speaks English and Spanish fluently . I don't know about the other languages though .
I thought it was going to be one of those games where both teams couldn't keep up with each other , but they just kept getting better and better .
That's what I was going to say ! He reminds me a lot of Riddler from Arkham City .
I don't think that's how it works , but I could be wrong .
It doesn't ? I thought that's what they were trying to do in A New Hope ...
Yes , it's their home kit .
I don't know why you're being downvoted . That's exactly what happened to us last time we hosted a Copa America .
Because ESPN is owned by Disney .
I'm rooting for you guys to win it all this year !
Because we don't want people to get their hopes up and then be disappointed when it turns out they were right all along !
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... I've seen a lot of people complain about this and have no idea what they are talking about .
Bozak is in the Hall of Fame though ...
Kemba is a free agent after this season , so he's not going to be on the team next year .
I'm pretty sure that's not what happened at all ...
I don't know if I should upvote or downvote this ...
I'm pretty sure that's what they were trying to tell us .
It's my favorite movie of all time , and I don't even like Lady in the Water !
I don't know , but I'm going to go ahead and say the latter .
I've never had a dog do that , but I can see how it could happen !
I'm pretty sure it's real , but I don't think they're going to be able to do that on a live broadcast .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what happened .
Yeah , I don't see it happening any sooner than the end of this century .
I was thinking the exact same thing when I first saw it !
I don't know , maybe they didn't want to reveal who was going to be playing Tracer at Blizzcon or something like that .
I don't know why you're being downvoted for pointing out the hypocrisy of your country's foreign policy .
I don't think Melo is going to want to play in New York after what happened last time he was there .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , I thought it was pretty funny !
I didn't expect him to be that good , but I'm glad he's doing well !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is a good point .
How much did it cost ?
I've been using it for a few days now and haven't noticed any difference in battery life at all .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but shamans have always been able to proc Windfury even before it was a thing .
Carrie Fisher is one of my all time favorite actors , but she's not even close to being as good looking as her character !
That's what I'm thinking as well , but it would have been nice if there was some sort of explanation for the whole thing .
That's a lot of money .
That's what I was thinking when I read the title lol
I'm going to go with a little of column A and a lot of column B .
Mammothosaurus is the closest we'll ever get in terms of size and that was one of my favorite dinosaurs !
That's not what he said at all ...
I've been looking for a grey one since they came out . They're so much more comfortable to hold in my hands :D
I'm not sure what you're trying to say but I think it's pretty clear that the article is talking about a specific case where someone was arrested for indecent exposure .
It's one of my all time favorite movies , you should give it a watch !
I don't think so . I'm pretty sure it's real and they've been around for quite some time .
She looks like she's about to fall down a flight of stairs at this point .
Longest I've ever heard of , yes .
Moulin Rouge is one of the best movies I've ever seen , you should check it out !
You and me both , brother .
Do it ! It's so much fun :D
Hulu is pretty good if you're into that sort of thing !
That would be great , thank you !
I'd pay to watch that !
I love that movie ! It's one of the few movies I haven't seen in years and it still holds up to this day .
Yeah , that's what I was thinking as well . It'd be nice if they gave us a little bit of variety in how we can use our talents .
I'll have to try that , thanks !
Don't listen to this guy he is just trying to make you feel better by telling you the same thing over and over again !
I don't think you know what extremely means .
I don't know why but your comment made me laugh way more than it should have ...
I don't know why , but this made me laugh harder than it should have .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's pretty much the exact opposite of what he said .
Looked like it to me too , but I don't know enough about refs to say for sure .
What was it called ?
I've never seen an OSHA regulation that didn't say something like “ if it s not for safety then why bother ? ”
I don't think that's how it works ...
Plants are people too !
It bothers me because I don't want to be called an autist for no reason !
I don't know why you're being downvoted for stating your opinion on the subject matter of a movie ...
I don't think it's that big of an issue with the game as long as they aren't too hard to deal with .
That's what I thought she was going to do , but it didn't work out ...
It's a good thing you're not in charge of anything then !
I'm Russian and I have no idea what you're talking about .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what happened .
It's just a prank bro !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is exactly what I was going to say .
That's the spirit !
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... this is true in the US as well !
That's what I was going to say ! It looks more like a diagonal line than an ellipsoid in my opinion .
That's what I was afraid of . Thanks !
It's just a prank bro !
That's a really good question . I don't know why you're being downvoted for asking an honest question ...
Korver isn't that bad , he's just not very good . I'd take him over Kyrie any day of the week .
Bevell is one of my favorite coaches in the league and I love him as a person but he doesn't seem to be very good at his job .
That's not what they're saying at all ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's a pretty accurate statement .
Oh yeah , forgot about that one !
I don't know , but that's what I would have done . They didn't even ask for my credit card info !
I don't think I've ever seen a movie that didn't make me want to watch the next one more than it did for him .
You're right , but that doesn't make it any less wrong .
That's the spirit !
They don't know what to do with their hands .
It's not you ! It's us !
I don't think I've ever had a beer that didn't smell like heineken or Budweiser at some point in my life .
I don't know why you're being downvoted for your opinion but I agree with this statement .
I'm sorry , but I don't know what you're trying to say ...
I'd love to see Portugal win , but I don't think that's going to happen :P
People who have no idea what they're doing .
I'm not saying Gurley or Kamara aren't good , I'm just saying there's a lot of talent in this draft that we haven't seen yet .
I don't think I've ever met a single person who doesn't want to ship moira and she's one of my favorite characters !
I don't think you know what that word means ...
You can still do that , you just have to turn it off and back on again :P
I was thinking the same thing , but I didn't want to be that guy ...
Thank you ! I made him out of plastic , and then painted over it with acrylic paint . He's still a little rough around the edges :P
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's a pretty accurate statement .
I like your style .
I'm not sure if that's what they were going for , but it made me laugh so hard :D
I don't think so , but I'm not an expert on the matter .
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry ...
That's what I'm wondering . He seems like the kind of guy who would have a lot of free time , but doesn't really care about it too much .
I'm pretty sure there are a lot of people who would like to do it , but they wouldn't be able to due to the laws of physics .
I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that about any of our players before this season ...
I don't know , but I'd like to read it !
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... it's a great movie !
I don't think so , but I could be wrong .

I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic , but I don't think this is going to happen anytime soon .
I'm not sure , but it seems to be working fine for me right now !
I don't know , ask them ?
I don't know why , but this made me laugh more than it should have .
I don't think I've ever met anyone who didn't root for the home team to win , even if it was an upset .
I would like to get in on this as well if it's not too much trouble ? My ign is the same as my username here :D
I don't think that would be very effective ...
Fortnite doesn't have anything to do with how good or bad the game is compared to other MOBA games , though .
I'm not sure if you're serious , but that's a great idea !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , I've had the game since launch and have no problems with it at all .
I don't know if you're being sarcastic or not but I'm pretty sure that was sarcasm ...
I don't think I've ever seen that word in my entire life .
He's been playing well for a while now , but I'm not sure if it'll be enough to keep his place on the team .
That's the spirit !
I don't know what you're talking about but I'm going to take your word for it !
I don't think that's how it works ...
That's what she said !
I think it's more along the lines of being attracted to them as individuals rather than a singular entity .
Excel is love , Excel is life .
I didn't even notice until I read your comment , lol .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote you ...
Depends on what you want to spend the money on , but it's definitely not that expensive if you're looking for something like this .
I don't know if I should upvote or downvote ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , there was a lot of bad officiating tonight but I didn't see any crying from either team .
Awesome ! Looking forward to seeing what you come up with :D
That's what I was thinking , he should have used the force !
keep going ?
I don't think so , but I could be wrong .
I don't think you know what backbone means ...
There's also a TV series coming out next year !
It's not like Genji can't do that , he just doesn't have to .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say but I don't think it makes any sense ...
I don't think I've ever seen him look this bad in his entire career at any point before or after last season .
They don't . That's the point of this thread .

It's going to be a great game ! I can't wait :D
Fisto would be a good name , but I don't think it's going to happen :P
I don't think I've ever heard anyone say he doesn't have good handles , they just aren't as easy to use because of how much time it takes him to get used to them .
I'm pretty sure that's a dude ...
Crabtree is one of my favorite players but I don't think he'd be a good fit for our team right now . Maybe next year though !
Because he's the best player in the league ?
Why not both ?
You should probably get that checked out if you don't mind me asking .
Fortnite isn't even close to what it used to be in terms of playerbase though . It's pretty much dead now .

That's because it wasn't a very good game to begin with ...
It's almost as if they're trying to make money or something ...
I don't even know what that means , but it sounds awesome !

I've done it a couple of times as well , but for some reason people don't seem to like me doing it anymore :P

I don't think he'll be able to get his head in the right place for a few weeks at least ...
I don't think he finished it , but I could be wrong .
Santorin and Santorin ?
It's a great show , but I don't think you'll find many people who can relate to him .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what I was thinking when I read the article .
I can't believe you've done this !
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote this , but it made me laugh for some reason .
I think it's because he hit him in the head with his shoulder . I could be wrong though .
Thanks Obama !

Cats are people too !
That's what she said ?

Karthus is one of my least favorite champs to play against because he's so squishy and easy to gank with his ult .
I thought I was going crazy for a second there ...

It's a trap !
That's because they don't know how to swim !

I don't know why you're getting downvoted for asking an honest question ...

Yes , he's also in The League .
Don't worry , you won't have to worry about that for a while ...
I don't think there's a single person in the world who hasn't heard of that town ...

That's what I was going for , yes .
I don't think that's how it works ...
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but I like it !

I'll take you up on that offer !
I don't know what to do with my hands ...

I don't know about others but for me it's a great way to get away from my family and friends !
RemindMe ! one year
Same here , I've been trying to do them all day but they're not showing up on my screen at all ...

That's what she said !
That's what he said !

I don't know why you're being downvoted for asking a legitimate question ...
It's not , it's just something that popped into my head and I wanted to share with people who might be interested in learning more about meditation .
I don't think that's going to end well ...
I don't think so , but I'll look into it and get back to you !
I don't think that's how it works ...
Thank you for your service !
Thank you for your service !
Pretty good so far . Hasn't given up a run yet but hasn't looked great either .
I don't think I've ever seen one of these in my life , but they're still pretty cool !
I think it's supposed to be conversing , but I could be wrong .
Thank you so much :D

I don't know if you're being serious or not but it's called “ parenting ” for a reason .

You better deliver !
That's what she said ?
I'm sorry , I didn't know it was against the rules of this subreddit or something like that . My bad !
I don't think he was trying to be condescending or anything like that ... He just didn't understand why people were so upset by this video .
I'm pretty sure it's just that they're not wearing their normal clothes for some reason lol
That's what I'm waiting for ! :D
I'm sure he would love that :D
I don't even know what that has to do with anything ...
I've been doing it for years . It's really not that hard , you just have to be careful about how much weight you're putting on the wheels .

I don't know why you're being downvoted , it really isn't funny in the slightest .

That would be a dream come true .
I don't see how that's relevant to my comment at all ...
Thank you so much lt 3

Zen is one of my favorite characters but he's just so much fun to play with :D

Lebron is the best player in the league right now so it s not surprising that he gets more playing time than any other point guard at his position .

I believe you are correct . Thanks !

What's wrong with myspace ?
I'm not sure what you mean by that . Can you elaborate ?
Not really , no . They were pretty clean in the first half of the season but they've been getting better since then .

I don't think I've ever been so confused in my life ...
I don't think that's what he was referring to ...
Don't worry , you won't .

He's a great player , but he doesn't deserve to be in the starting XI over Koscielny and Mertesacker .
Because they don't have to worry about their country being invaded by a bunch of other countries , right ? s
You and me both !
That's what I'm trying to tell myself at this point ...
I don't think we've ever made it past the divisional round as an expansion team though ...
Thank you so much lt 3
I'm sorry for your loss !
I don't know why you're being downvoted . I've been using google play music for years and have never heard anyone say anything bad about it .
I don't know . I've never heard of it being used as an aphrodisiac in any way shape or form .
I was thinking the same thing . He looks like he could be wearing one of their kits , but I don't think that's it .
I think he was the best part of that movie , and it's not even close .
I don't think he'll be able to make it that long without fouling out ...
That's what I figured , thanks !
I'd say so . It's a great game , but you can't go wrong with either !
I hope so , he's my favorite character and I want more of him in the show .
It's not like you're going to be able to get ahold of him anyway ...
I haven't , but I'll have to check that out !
I don't think that's how it works ...
Hayward isn't coming back , he's out for the rest of the season with a torn meniscus in his right knee .
It's not that easy when you live in an apartment complex where there isn't much else to do ...
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad about that .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is a valid question .
That's what I thought it was at first , but they're not the same .
That's what I was thinking , but it doesn't hurt to ask .
That's the spirit !
It's a great show , but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't know what they're in for .
I don't know , but I'm pretty sure it's a vegetable .
That would be awesome , but I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon .
I think he's talking about the first drive of this game .
That's what I was afraid of , thanks !
You're the funniest person in this thread by far lt 3
I don't know why you're being downvoted because I'm pretty sure that's exactly what he was saying .

I think it's more that he didn't like how they looked compared to his other LOTR books and just wanted something different .
I thought it was called the hospital pass ?
It's been that way for a few weeks now .
I'm not saying it doesn't work , I just don't think that was a good call .
What kind of fast food do you work at ?
They're not , but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be !
It's on ESPN 3 if you have that .
I don't know why you're being downvoted because this is exactly what happened to me when I got my first job out of college .
Thanks for the advice , I'll keep that in mind !
I know , I'm just saying that he hasn't been able to keep up with what's going on at this point in time .
I'm not a big fan of it . It's too slow and I don't really like the idea of being able to cast spells on my opponents turn .
That's a great idea , thanks !
You monster !

Lebron had a better supporting cast in Miami than Lebron does now , so I don't know what you're talking about .

Vegetarianism is so much easier than veganism , you should try it !
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... I think that's a great idea !
I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be a reference to an anime series called Code Geass .
I was so excited for that movie to come out , and then the trailer showed up on my front page with no warning of a release date ...
It wasn't bad , but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece . It's definitely worth the watch though !
Goblin slayer doesn't seem like the kind of thing he'd do ...
I don't think Purdue is that good of a team right now . They need to get their confidence back before they start playing like this again .
I don't think he was able to get a good grip on the car . He didn't seem too happy about it either .
I don't think I've ever met a person who didn't love their dog more than they loved themselves .

I don't think that's how it works ...

I can't believe you've done this .
That's what I've been doing for the last few years , but it doesn't seem to have worked out so well :P
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what I was thinking !

Lionel Hutz was the best lawyer I've ever heard of !
Dillashaw looked like he was going to get knocked out in the first round . I don't know what you're talking about .

Upvoted.Back please .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that was a good one !

Ken Bone is a national treasure !
That's what I figured , thanks !
We used to do this in the late 80 ' s and early 90 ' s , but I think it was more expensive back then than now .

Don't worry , you're not the only one who feels that way !

No problem , good luck with your project .
I don't know why you're being downvoted because that's exactly what will happen if a no deal is made .
Nope , you're not .
Why not both ?

Haha , I didn't even notice that . Good eye !
I don't think I've ever seen a comedy that didn't make me laugh hysterically every single time !
I don't think so . I'm sure there will be more than one or two teams in the group stages though .
That and the fact that you don't have to worry about getting your hands wet while doing so .
I don't know what that means , but I'm going to upvote anyway .
That's the spirit !
Thanks for the support !
Thanks for the support !

You can have mine ! :D

I've never met someone who didn't speak spanish in my entire life , but it's probably because they're not from the US .
I have , but they don't seem to be interested in helping me pay off my student loans ...
I don't think so , but I'm not an expert on such things .
That's what she said ?
Thanks for your interest ! We'll get back to you as soon as we know what's going on :D
I don't think so , but I'm not a fan of either team at this point in their respective seasons .
I don't know what that means but I like it .
They won't be able to vote . That's all I'm saying .
Thanks for the advice ! I'll keep that in mind when it comes time to move on with my life .

Jenson Button .
Lebron's knees are fine . They just don't heal like they used to , and it takes a long time for them to fully recover .
That's what they want you to think . Don't fall for it !
Thanks , I'll be sure to post a video when it's done .
That's what I figured , thanks !
I feel your pain , I have both of those players on my team .

I m not sure if you re being serious or not , but I think it s just a joke .
They can , but it's more expensive and time consuming to do so than just replacing the wires themselves .
How much did it cost ?
I don't know , but I'd watch it .
I'll check it out , thanks !

I don't really have one . I'm not a big fan of seafood , but that's just me .
I think you might be on to something ...
Because that would make too much sense .
I'm down for that .
That's what she said !
That would actually be really cool to see !
That's what happens when you have a good defense .

Pouncey was drafted by the Dolphins , so you're not really missing out on much ...
That's what I was thinking . He should have been able to get out of bounds , but he didn't do anything wrong there .

I don't know why , but this made me laugh .

He'll be fine , he's been drinking it all day !
You would be surprised at how many people do not know the difference between a knife and a spoon .
You're right , it's a bit of an overreaction on my part to be honest !

I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's true .
I don't know if I'm allowed to say , but there was an episode where they were trying to make a movie out of their LNs ...
Yu Yu Hakusho is still one of my favorite animes , along with Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and Nisemonogatari !
I don't have the money right now , but I'll look into it . Thanks !
Khabib said he was sick and wanted to be out of there as soon as possible , but they didn't let him back in for some reason .
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote ...
Yeah , I'm not sure what they're going to do with this game if it doesn't have one ...
That's what I figured , thanks !
Zlatan and diving .
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... this is the truth !
Looked like they were trying to get the ball out of his hands , but he didn't have time .
I don't think so , but I'm not an expert on bird law .
I think he was trying to make a joke , but it wasn't funny at all .
I don't think that would be an issue if I lived in my own apartment and didn't use any roommates .
That's the spirit !
You're not you when you're hungry !
Love you too lt 3
I'm sure you'll have a lot of great grandchildren !

That's the spirit !

I don't know why you're being downvoted ... this is exactly what was going through my mind when I read your comment .
I don't think it's a requirement , but I'm not American so I can't speak on behalf of all Americans .
I think they were trying to make it look like she didn't know who he was .
I don't think there's ever been a competitive team that didn't have at least one or two games where they couldn't come out on top .
That's not how that works at all . Peacocks can only be picked once every four days or something like that .
I can't believe you've done this !
That's what she said .
That's the spirit !
I don't think they're going to be able to do that because of the way Snipping Tool works on Win 8.1 and above .
I don't get it , can someone explain ?
Don't worry , you'll be able to swim in no time !
I don't think that's how it works ...
I don't know . I've never been to either of those places !
It's been a long time since we've had an SEC Championship game that wasn't at the end of last season .

I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is a very real possibility .
I don't think it's going to be bad at all , just not as good as the first one .
Yeah , I noticed that too . It looks like it's about the same size as last time we saw her !
I don't think I've ever seen a movie with him in it that didn't make me want to gouge my eyes out .
I don't think there's a single person on this sub that doesn't want him in LA .
I don't think I've ever been so happy to be wrong !
You are not alone .
Welcome to the club !
I'm down for that !
Futurama is one of the best animated shows ever made , and that's coming from someone who doesn't like Futurama at all .
I don't think that's how it works ...
Me too thanks
I don't think you know what that word means ...
Nah , I just don't want to be a burden on my family and friends when they need it most .
That's what I'm going to do when I get home from work ! Thank you so much for your help :D
I don't get it . Can someone explain ?
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not but that doesn't make any sense at all ...
Moisturize me !
That's the spirit !
The 80 ' s and 90 ' s were pretty good for me as well !

I think it's because of the way he moves his hands around , but that might be my imagination ...
I've never seen one , but I'm sure it's a lot more common than you'd think .
I've heard it both ways !
I am the senate !
That's what they want you to think . They don't actually believe that at all .
2016 was a great year for celebrity deaths and it's not even close to being over yet !
That's what I was thinking . He should have just walked out of there and left it at that .
You're not supposed to be able to use your ulti on garen , you have to wait for it to come off cooldown before using it again .
No , you're not . I think it looks great !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic ...
I was just thinking the same thing , he looks so much faster than last year !
I'm not sure what you're trying to say here .
That's what she said !
That's what I'm thinking . They won't do anything about it , but that doesn't mean there isn't a chance for them to make another one .
I don't think I've ever been to one that didn't have steak on the menu , but it's certainly not unheard of .
I don't think you know what that word means .
I've never had an issue with people taking longer than a minute or two , especially if I'm trying to get something done in less than 5 minutes .

Haha , that's a good one too !
That's what I thought at first , but it looked like he was trying to make a play on the ball and didn't have control of his arm yet .
Thank you ! That's exactly what I was going for :D
It's not that bad if you don't mind living in one of the most expensive places on Earth .
I don't think he'd be able to handle the pressure of being in front of a live studio audience for an extended period of time .
Nekros doesn't really need an augment , he just needs to be in the right place at the right time .
And the other didn't .
That's not a fun fact at all ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's exactly what happened .
I've never seen one of those magnets in the wild so it's hard for me to believe that there are people out there who don't have them ...

Haha , me too ! :D
David Moyes .
I love my job . It's a lot of work but it pays well and I get to spend time with people who care about me .
There are dozens of us ! Dozens !
I'd watch that .
I don't think that word means what you think it means .
That's what she said .
It's been a long time since we've played them , but they were fun to watch !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this was my first thought as well .
Banned from this one .
I don't think I've ever heard him say anything about grapes in his life other than they're delicious and he loves them .
Yes , but only if you pay him .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say but I like it !
That's what she said ?
Amartey is a great player but I don't think he's ready for the first team at this point in his career .
I'd be okay with this .
That's what I love about kids , they can be so confident in their own abilities !
It's not you , it's me !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but that's an awesome feature !
I'm sure there will be some sort of compensation , but I wouldn't hold my breath on it being anything substantial .
That's what I'm hoping for too !
Gorillas don't have muscles , they're just fat .
He's playing himself !
That's what she said !
I don't think that's how it works ...
That's what I was thinking too . What kind of person doesn't know how to make an ice cream sandwich with peanut butter or chocolate chips in it ?
I don't know why but this made me laugh way more than it should have .
I don't see it either . I'm on mobile though so maybe that's why ...
Thanks , I'll look into it !
It's just you .
I'm glad to see you're enjoying it !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not ...

You're a good man .
That's what she said !
I think it's a tie between A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back for me .
It's not about the money it's about sending a message !
His best .
I'm pretty sure there's going to be at least 2 more characters in the game after this one is over .
Diablo 3 is one of the best games out there right now and you can play it for hours on end if you're into that kind of thing .
I don't think that's how it works ...
I'm pretty sure that's what they were going for , but it didn't come out right .
What kind of soda ?
Interesting , thanks for letting me know ! I'll look into it and see if there's any changes in that regard .
I don't think I've ever been so excited for a movie in my life as I am right now !
I know , right ? :D
Thank you for the encouragement !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but that's exactly what they were going for in the first place .
I don't think I've ever seen an animated movie where the characters didn't look like they were made in MS Paint .
That's what I thought at first , but there was no way that could have been done in such a short amount of time .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , I thought it was funny .
I don't know if I should laugh or cry ...
I was born in ' 96 and I'm still young enough to be an adult !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's true !
I think it's more to do with the fact that most people don't even know what cursive writing looks like , let alone how they should use it .
You'll get there ! :D
That's a good point , I didn't think of that !
That's what she said ?
That's what I was thinking too . They're not going to go for it if they don't get a treat , right ?
Shawshank is still my favorite movie of all time , and I've seen it at least 10 times since its release .
You're welcome , I'm glad it helped !
I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at a comment on this sub before !
Missed a field goal that would have put them in FG range and they missed the extra point instead of going for 2 on 4th down .
What is your favorite ?
I don't know about that , but it's a good idea . She is one of my favorite characters in this game !
I don't think you know what PC means ...
Home is one of my all time favorites , I can't wait for more !
No , but I'll give it a shot . Thanks !
I'd rather not .

Didn't he have a concussion last week ?
That's what I thought too , but it doesn't have the same ring to it .
Thank you , I appreciate the feedback !
That's what they want you to think ...
I don't think I've ever heard of a cat who doesn't want to nap , or at least not as much as humans do .

It's a play on words from the movie The Big Lebowski :P
I thought he was the best part of Signals .
I like the way you think !
I don't get it . What's the joke ?
Ogbonna is going to be so good for me . I've been using him in my Serie A squad and he's amazing !
I don't know why you're being downvoted for pointing out that lying under oath isn't an act of cowardice ...
I love them , but I don't think they're very popular in Brazil .
That's the spirit !
I don't think that's what he was saying , but I could be wrong .
That's what I was going to say , but you beat me to it !
I'm in the same boat as you :D
That makes sense ! Thanks for clearing that up :D
It depends on what you want to do in the future , but it's definitely worth considering !
I don't think I've ever seen one of those signs in my entire life , but they're all over this sub anyway so who cares ?
That's exactly what I'm doing right now !
I don't know if you're being sarcastic or not , but it's a quote from the movie The Big Lebowski .
I don't know , but I'm sure there are plenty of people who would be interested in watching it .
I don't think that's how it works . I'm pretty sure you're supposed to be able to get one for free if you pre order or something like that .
I don't think you know what chugging means ...
He's a good coach , but he doesn't know how to play the game of football .

I don't think you know what that word means ...
That's because they don't know how to use the search function , and are too lazy to do it themselves .
I wish I could do that , but it's too late for me to get out of work by then !
I don't know why you got downvoted so much for expressing an opinion on a topic of interest to me :P
I don't know why you're being downvoted , I thought the same thing at first too !
I'll take two please .
I'm sorry for your loss !
That's what I keep telling myself but it doesn't seem to be working ...
I don't , but I've driven one before . It's an amazing car !
That's what I'm going to do , thanks !
That's what I figured . Thanks !
I don't know what you're talking about , but I'm gonna go ahead and say no .
Yeah , but that's not the same as what we're talking about ...
I don't get it . What's going on ?
I don't know , but I'm pretty sure it's not real .
That's what they want you to think !
It's not ironic , it's coincidental !
I don't think you know what insufferably means ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's a valid criticism .
That's why you don't go to the movies !
I'd watch that .
I don't think they're going to do anything about it . It's not a big deal , but I'm sure there are plenty of people who wouldn't mind getting their money back .

It's a reference to an episode of Futurama , where Fry and Leela were talking about how they couldn't eat their food because it was too salty .
I don't know , but I'm pretty sure they're not going to be in the same group .
I don't think so , but I'll look into it . Thanks !
I think it was an airball , but I could be wrong .
I'm not saying it's a bad thing . I just don't think he should be in the conversation at this point of his career .
That's what I figured . Thanks !
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... I thought it was funny !
I don't think so . It's not like they're playing in the Champions League or anything , right ?

I don't think that's how it goes ...

I think you're on to something ...
I think he's going to be a big part of the show for sure !

I'm not sure what you're trying to say with this comment , but it doesn't make any sense .
I think it's more the fact that he didn't win any oscars , but still got snubbed out of razzies and won best actor in his own right .
How do you plant them ? I've been trying to figure that out for a while now ...
You don't have to , but it's a lot easier if you're playing on hard .

I think that's what happened to me with The Big Lebowski !

I don't know , I've never had one . :P
I don't think that's how it works ...
That's what I was going to say , but you beat me to it .
I don't see why they wouldn't give it to him . It's not like he doesn't have experience or anything ...
I don't know what to believe anymore ...
I don't know why you are being downvoted , that is exactly what they are !
I don't know if you're being sarcastic or not but that was my first thought when the trailer came out :P
Sounds like a good plan to me !
It's not an excuse , it's a fact .
He was , but I don't think it would have been a catchable ball .
That's an interesting idea . I like it !
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... this is exactly what happened !

Thank you so much ! That means a lot to me lt 3
I don't think that's what he was implying .
What's a chippy ?
I didn't see that until you pointed it out , but the resemblance is uncanny !
I'm pretty sure it's a lot more complicated than that ...
I'd watch that movie !
That's what I thought at first , but the ears are too big for that .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is an accurate statement .
Thank you ! That's what I was going for :D

I don't think I've ever heard an announcer say anything that wasn't biased towards the team they were talking about in any of their games .
You are now a moderator at r pyongyang

It's not about the money , it's about sending a message .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is exactly what happened to me !
Bulls don't have enough cap space to sign him , so I doubt it .
Bend and snap !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's a valid question .
No , it's just a practice field .
I don't think I've ever been so excited for a game to come out in my life as I am right now .
That's what I was thinking , but it would be nice to have some sort of notification for those who haven't been notified yet .
I don't think Saudi Arabia has ever had a stable government before , so I wouldn't worry too much about stability there .
I don't know why , but this made me laugh way more than it should have .
I don't know why I didn't think of that , thanks !
I don't think they deserve to be ranked at all , but that's just my opinion .
I was thinking the exact same thing ! I'm not sure if it's supposed to be funny or sad ...
That's what I thought at first , but it looks like his shoes are still on !
I don't know what you're talking about . I've never heard of such a thing !
They all look the same to me .
I don't know why you're being downvoted for pointing out the obvious fact that France has never won a World Cup ?
That's what I'm talking about :P
He's been doing that for a while now . I don't know why he doesn't do it more often ...
What time zone are you ?
I don't think he'd be a good fit , but I wouldn't rule it out either .
Craig FTFY
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... I've never heard of a wet wipe saying it's flammable or inflammable .
I don't think Ssumday is good enough to be on a team like CLG , IMT or TSM . He doesn't fit their style of play at all .
That's not true at all . He has a lot of time on his hands , but that doesn't mean he can't do other things as well .
I think it's a toss up between Kearse and Lockette at this point in the season .
There is , you just have to wait .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , I thought it was pretty funny that he didn't even try to save his team from getting blown up ...
Me too please !
I don't think I've ever heard him say it that way , but he didn't sound like a native English speaker either .
You're right , I'm thinking of Gretzky from the movie The Big Lebowski !
What do you think of the new Star Wars movies ?
Ozzie is one of my favorite coaches in the league and he's done wonders for our team over the past few years .
You can't lock up the darkness !
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote ...
That's what I'm hoping too , but it looks like they're going in that direction !
That's a really good idea , thanks !
The refs ?
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that's not gonna happen .
I don't think that's who you're thinking of ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's a perfectly cromulent phrase .
That's not what the rulebook says , though .
I was thinking the same thing , but I don't think that's a good idea if you want to be able to sleep at night .
I'm pretty sure that's what he was getting at ...
I don't think you know what the word gullible means ...
I don't think you know what that word means .
I don't think that's how it works ...
That's the dream !
I think you guys are going to win . I don't see us losing by more than 10 points though .
That's what happens when you play against the Rams .
That's what she said !
That's a great way to put it :D
I'm pretty sure that's what he was referring to when he said don't hit me with your left hand !
I don't think I've seen a theater that wasn't full of people who didn't know what they were doing .
I don't know what I'm doing with my life .
I don't know why you're being downvoted when it's the truth ...
I'm pretty sure he was blind for most of his time on Earth 2 but I could be wrong about that .
The plot thickens .
That would make me so happy !
It's a trap !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is exactly what's going on .
I don't think it's that big of a deal . I'm sure they'll be able to get something for him at the end of his contract .
I don't know if I should laugh or cry ...
Biscuits and gravy is the best !
I think he was trying to tell him not to do that , but it didn't work so well ...
You and me both !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not but it's a pretty common thing for people to do when they feed their pets food .
I'm not sure , but I think it's a draw .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is the correct answer .
That s a lot of downvotes lol
That's what I'm waiting for as well !
What's wrong with whatsapp ?
That's not what I was asking , but thanks for clarifying !
I don't see how that's relevant to the topic at hand .
Germans and penalties .
I don't know why , but this made me giggle .
Let us know how it goes , good luck !
That would be great , thanks !
I'll have to give it a try , thanks !
That's what I was thinking , but it doesn't really make any sense does it ?
That's what I'm hoping for too !
I'd buy one !
I don't understand why they didn't ban him . He's one of the most popular picks right now and has been for quite some time .
I don't think you understand what “ evidence ” means .
I was thinking the exact same thing . I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing ...
That's what I was thinking . He didn't even try to fight him , he just stood there and let the other guy get away with it .
I don't know what you're talking about . I've never heard of such a thing !
RemindMe ! 2 years
They don't have to choose , they're all British .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , I thought it was pretty funny !
I can't believe you've done this .
That's a good question . I don't think anyone has ever been able to answer that yet .
You're not the only one who's seen it !
I think it's going to be some sort of teaser for a new game or something like that .
I know , but I don't think that's what OP was asking about .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not ...
I've never had it but I'll have to give it a try !
And my axe !
Zidane would be a great fit for us but I don't think he'd want to come back at this point in his career .
You and me both , brother .
I don't think so , but I'm not sure . It's been a while since I've had to do something like that .
This is why we can't have nice things !
I don't think I've ever seen a Lee Sin that didn't look like he was going to die at some point in this game .
I don't think we're going to be able to win a game this year , but I'll take it !
Harvey is one of my all time favorite movies and a great recommendation !
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not , but I'll take your word for it !
Pepperidge Farm remembers .
It never had it to begin with ...
Don't forget Welsh !
That's what she said ?
That's what she said !
Thank you so much ! That means a lot to me lt 3
I don't have a gaming PC yet . I'm going to get one in the next few months though !
Croatia is a great team and I hope you guys do well !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what happened to me when I was diagnosed with mesothelioma a few years ago .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is exactly what happened to me when I moved out of my parents'home for college .
I'm the exact same age as you and it's going to be my 18th bday too lol
I don't think that's how it works ...
I'm not sure what you mean by that . I don't have any of these games on my PS4 and they work just fine for me .
If you have to ask , then yes .
That's what I was thinking of when I saw this post , too !
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... this is exactly what I was going to say !
You're welcome ! I'm glad you got the help you needed .
RemindMe ! 24 hours
That's what she said .
Don't you put that evil on us !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what happened !
I don't think that's it , but thanks for the input !
That's what I figured , thanks !
That's what she said .
That's a good point , I hadn't thought of that !
That's what she said !
Zapdos is one of the rarest Pok mon in the game , so you should be fine .
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... it's true !
Peeta was the only one who knew how to use a bow .
I still do , but I used to too !
Another one bites the dust is my favorite song of all time and I've been listening to it non stop for a few years !
I don't know , but that's what she said .
I'm pretty sure that's his real name ...
I don't think that's what she was thinking .
I don't know if you're serious or not ... but that sounds like it would be delicious !
Where do you live ? I've been looking for a new car but can't seem to find one .
No , you're not . That's just the way it is in this country .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's a very valid point .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I've never heard of it until now .
I'm sorry to hear that . I hope you feel better soon !
That's a really good rule , thanks !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what I was thinking when I read your comment .
That's what I've been doing , just wanted to make sure there wasn't a better option out there that would be worth the extra money .
I don't know why you're being downvoted for speaking the truth ... but if it makes you feel any better , at least one of us will be dead by then .
I don't think I've ever heard of this movie , but what's so great about it ?
Didn't even get a shot on goal in his first 10 minutes !
That's what I'm hoping for !
I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that before , but it makes sense !
That's what I've been doing , but it doesn't seem to be working out so well ...
There's one right down the street from my house . I've never been there , but it sounds delicious !
He'll be back at some point , just not soon enough .
That's what I was afraid of , thanks !
That's not how it works ...
I don't think that's how it works ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but that's actually my middle name ! :D
That's the best kind of balance !
I love that scene , but I can't help but wonder what would have happened if he didn't ?
I don't know why you're being downvoted because this is exactly what I was going to say !
Closest you're going to get is Tom Hiddleston , no ?
i gotchu fam
That's what she said .
Because our defense is bad .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what happened !
That's what I figured . Thanks !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's a pretty good analogy !
That's what I thought at first , but it doesn't look like any of them are wearing masks .
I don't think you know what that word means .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , I thought it was funny !
Yeah , that was my first thought as well . I'm glad it's not just me who thinks this is a bad idea .
Trigun is one of my all time favorite shows , it's so good !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's what I'm thinking as well .
That's what happens when you don't exercise for a year or two and then start working out again .
That's what she said .
You're welcome :D
I've never been to Zaxbys so I can't comment on that , but their chicken tenders are delicious !
Fouts is the only one I don't have a problem with , but that's just me .
I'm in the same boat as you . I hope it's a good one !
I'd do that in a heartbeat . I don't think either of those guys are going anywhere anytime soon though .
I don't think she's that bad , but I wouldn't call her one of the best or even top 10 at this point .
I've been using Sync for a few months now ... It's great !
You're welcome , glad you enjoyed it !
I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at something in my entire life !
What's your favorite color ?
I don't know why you're getting downvoted for this ... I think it's a pretty valid point !
You're doing God's work !
I don't know why I didn't think of this ... Thanks !
I don't get it either . It's like they're trying to sell me something but I'm not seeing anything ...
I'm from Maryland too ! :D
I don't think he's good enough to replace Gronk , but I wouldn't mind having him on our team at all .
I'm pretty sure that's the joke .
Happy Cake Day :D
I don't get it , what's the problem ?
I don't know what you're trying to say with that comment but it's not even close lol
I didn't even notice until I read your comment lol
I was going to say the same thing :D
That's what happens when you don't play defense .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not ...
Did it hurt ?
That's not how it works ...
That's a good way to look at it . I don't know why people are downvoting your comment though ...
D amp D characters aren't even real people so it doesn't really matter what you think about them .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say with that quote but it doesn't make any sense ...
I'm good , how about yourself ?
I don't get it , can someone explain ?
Because it's a title , not an article .
I don't know but I'm pretty sure you guys are going to have a better record than us next year !
I don't know what this means , but it sounds like a lot of fun !
I don't know why you're being downvoted because this is a very valid point .
That's not how it works ...
I don't think that's how it works ...
I'd pay to see that !
I would if I could , yes .
No , that's not it but thanks for trying !
I don't think I've ever been so happy to be wrong !
I'd watch that !
I don't think you know what loyalty means ...
I'm pretty sure he's still trying to figure out how to dribble with his left foot ...
You are correct . Extinction means no one has ever seen or heard of a species that was wiped out in the last 100 million years .
I don't think I've ever heard of this guy before , but he seems like a pretty cool dude !
That's what I was thinking , but it sounds like they're trying to make him sound more Canadian than he actually is .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is exactly what I was thinking !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is the correct answer .
I'm not sure what you're trying to get at here ...
I know , I was just making a joke about how Alabama is the only team that can beat us this year and it's not even close .
We have one , it's just that he doesn't know how to throw the ball ...
We don't have a football team .
I don't know , but it looks delicious .
I don't think you know what that word means .
I'm sure they would if it wasn't for that pesky fence ...
I'm not sure , but I think it might have been a group of people who were trying to sneak up on him or something like that .
I'm sorry to hear that , but at least you were able to figure it out !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what I was thinking !
I'm not sure if I should upvote or downvote you for this comment .
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... it's the truth !
Ryze is love , Ryze is life .
Yeah , I'm not sure what you're trying to say here ...
Thank you so much for the kind words :D
Thank you very much for your answer !
I don't know what you're talking about , but I'll take your word for it !
How much do they cost ?
I don't know about that , but there are definitely a lot of Cards fans here !
Don't be sorry , you're doing a good job of it .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's true !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is the most likely explanation .
I don't know , but I'm going to go ahead and guess that it doesn't affect anything at all .
He got hit in the head with a chair .
I don't think I've ever heard of that one . Is it any good ?
Haha , I didn't even notice that until you pointed it out !
I don't think it'll happen but I would be so happy if that happened !
I'm sorry for your loss !
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... it's a good idea !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is a pretty accurate description of what happened .
I've always thought it was funny that people name their pets after animals they don't even know the breed of !
I don't think so , but I'm not going to hold my breath ...
I can't wait ! I've been wanting to watch this show since it first came out .
I don't get it , can you explain ?
I think it's going to be the best thing since sliced bread .
It bothers me too , but I don't know why . It's not like they're going to be wearing them in the playoffs or anything ...
Khajit is my favorite race , and I'm not even a khajit !
I don't think you know what that word means .
This is the best idea I've heard all day !
No , she died .
Let's do this !
I don't know if it's legal but I've seen a lot of people get fired for not being able to stay on call or something like that .
That's a good idea , I'll give it a shot . Thanks !
That's not how it works ...
Wade is one of my favorite players in the league and he's going to be an all star this year !
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... I thought it was pretty funny !
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but I can't stop giggling at that one !
I don't know why you're being downvoted . This sub is weird sometimes ...
Yeah but it was an episode where they were trying to find out if she had died or not so we don t know for sure yet .
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... I'm sure a lot of people have used UPlay to get their games onto steam and vice versa .
I don't know about white castle , but there are many other fast food chains that have been around longer than McDonald's has existed .
I don't think you know what autistic means .
I don't think so , but I'm not sure . We'll have to wait and see !
Alexis has been poor for a while now , I think he's just getting back to his old form from last season .
I'm sure there's an app for that ...
I thought he was going to throw it back at him .
That's what she said !
I don't think that's how it works ...
I don't think that's how it works ...
I don't think it's anything to do with Canada but rather the fact that there are so many different types of skis out there and they all look similar .
That would be awesome . Thank you so much :D
Don't you put that evil on us !
I have one of these as well and love it . It's my go to carry gun , especially if you're hunting or something like that .
Used , thanks !
I don't think there's a single person on this sub who doesn't have an irrational hatred of the University of Cincinnati .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but I don't see how that's relevant ?
I live in a big city and it's pretty common to have locks on your front door , even if you're not living there anymore .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not but there were quite a few WoW players back then as well .
I don't think that's how economics works ...
I don't know , but I'm pretty sure that's not a dog ...
Zenyatta is one of the most powerful characters in the game so I don't see why this would be a problem ?
That's what I'm hoping for !
I've never been there so I can't say for sure but that would be my guess .
I didn't even notice that until you pointed it out ! That's pretty messed up ...
I don't think you know what that word means ...
That's a bold prediction Cotton .
I don't think he'll be there , but I wouldn't rule out the idea of trading back and picking up someone who fits our system better .
I don't think I've ever been so happy to be wrong !
That's what I'm thinking as well , thanks !
I don't know why you're being downvoted when it's true ...
The refs are trying to make up for the lack of calls in this game .
That's what I was thinking too , but they didn't even look at each other and just went straight for it !
Sounds like a plan !
Fizz is one of the most fun champs to play , I don't see how that's a bad thing ?
That's what she said .
I'm with you . It's fun to watch , but it doesn't make me want to go out and buy a new pair of pants .
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to inhale through my nose though ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... I thought it was pretty funny !
That's what I get for typing on my phone and not paying attention to the spell checker :P
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's a valid criticism of the series .
Christmas Vacation is one of the funniest comedies on TV right now IMO !
Don't forget Pulp Fiction !
See what he did ? It's too late for him to care !
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... It's pretty clear that the majority of Canadians are in agreement with your statement .
That's what she said ?
You and me both !
Little of column A , little of column B ...
I don't know about DBZ or One Piece but I'm pretty sure Death Note will be a part of the next season !
Was she hot ?
I don't think I've ever seen a post on this sub that didn't have at least one mom pic in it .
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted but whatever floats your boat lol
This is the only correct answer .
Yeah , me too . It would have been nice to see some new characters though .
I don't really have any goals , I just want to be able to live a happy life .
I don't know why you're being downvoted for making a very good point .
If you like survival horror games check out Dead Island : The Presequel if you're looking for more of those types of games .
Link please ?
I don't think it's that big of a deal , but some people just want to see what they can get for their money .
I still have a copy of that on my hard drive somewhere ...
I don't know what's going on in this thread but I'm upvoting it anyway !
Michael Scott
That's what she said ?
Because that's what it says in the article .
This is the only one I can think of off the top of my head , sorry !
I don't think I've ever heard of him , but he's definitely on my list !
This is what I'm looking for , thanks !
Bottas pitted at the same time as Verstappen so there's no reason for him to be faster than both of them .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what I was thinking !
I don't think I've ever seen someone do that in my entire life and not get a good laugh out of it .
It sure is :D
I don't want no trouble .
That's what I figured . Thanks !
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is a very valid point .
He's not a hall of famer , but he is an all time great and deserves to be in the HOF at some point .
I don't know why you're being downvoted . It's a good question , and an interesting one at that .
I think it was both .
I don't think they'll be able to get a hold of him since he's in China right now ...
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this one : I don't care what anyone says about me , as long as I win !
Thanks ! :D
I don't know why you're being downvoted for having a different opinion than everyone else on this sub ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted , there are plenty of reasons not to vote for him .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I think it's safe to say that Urgot isn't very good right now .
That's what I thought at first too , but it looks like they're in the middle of some sort of rap battle !
I don't think I've ever heard that before , but it makes sense !
That's what she said !
That's what happens when you don't score a single goal in the first 30 minutes of each match !
I don't think that word means what you think it means ...
That was the first thing I thought of when I read your comment :D
That's because you don't listen to music while lifting or working out ... ?
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but it doesn't really make sense ...
I don't think so . I'm pretty sure it's not against the law to take a picture of someone without their consent .
I'm not sure what you're trying to say , but I don't think that's how it works ...
That's not really relevant to the point I was making ...
That's what she said ?
That's the best part !
I'm not sure what that has to do with anything , but okay .
I don't know why you're being downvoted when it's true ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted for saying that Michelle Obama was one of the worst presidents in American history .
That's a good idea , I'll look into that !
I'm not sure where you're from but I've never heard anyone refer to anything as an overlord or something like that in my life .
I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at anything in this show , but that scene did it for me .
That would have been so much funnier !
That's what I thought at first too lol
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... I've seen a lot of people do this and it doesn't look real to me .
I'm not sure if you're being serious , but he's been dead for a while now ...
Done.back to me , thx
I don't think so , but I'm not 100 sure . It's been awhile since I've read anything about him .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , I'm pretty sure OP is just trying to get karma from people who haven't seen his post before .
Yes . Yes I did .
I'm sorry , I didn't realize it was against the rules of this subreddit . Thank you !
He got fouled on that last one .
That's what she said ?
I've never been to a game , so I don't know much about them . But from what I can tell it's pretty quiet compared to other teams in the state .
I don't think I've ever heard of this , but it sounds like a great idea !
That's what she said !
I don't think that's how it works ...
I don't know why but this made me laugh more than it should have .
How much did you pay for your water last year ?
That's what she said ?
Viktor isn't a bad pick , it's just that he doesn't fit into the meta at all .
I don't think you know what summary means .
That's not really an exception though , it's just a coincidence that they're located there .
That's what she said .
Thanks for the heads up , but I'm not really into that kind of stuff :P
That's what she said !
I don't know , but I'm pretty sure that's not a good look for him .
I'd watch that !
I don't think you understand what I'm trying to say ...
I don't know why you're being downvoted . I thought it was pretty funny !
I don't think so . He doesn't seem to have a sense of humor , at least in my opinion .
Where do you live ? That sounds like an amazing deal !
I was thinking the same thing , but I'm not sure if that's what they were going for in this case ...
I was thinking the same thing ! I think he would have been perfect for that role .
I don't know why you're being downvoted but this is the best advice I've heard so far .
I've had a few people tell me it is , but I don't know enough about them to say for sure .
I'm fine with it , but I don't want to see them play each other again .
I don't think he's dead yet .
Bend represent !
It's just a prank bro !
I don't think you know what an all nba team is ...
It's not a spoiler if you don't want to be spoiled .
That's actually a really good idea , but I don't know if we can do that with our schedule right now ...
I was waiting for him to get hit by a car .
Haha , I didn't even notice him until you pointed it out :D

I don't know why you're being downvoted , I thought it was pretty funny !
That's a good point . I didn't think about that !
I think that's because the movie is set in a different time period than what we're used to seeing on screen .
Because it wasn't a Batman movie .
That's what I was going to say , but you beat me to it !

I don't know , but I'm pretty sure we do .
Kawhi is the only one who can do that , and he's not going anywhere anytime soon .

I don't really eat sandwiches , but if you're into that kind of thing then there are some good ones out there !

Don't worry , there's still plenty of time for you to come back !

That's what I thought too , but it seems to be working so far !
That's a good point , I didn't think about that !
That's what I figured , thanks !

I'm sorry to hear that ! I hope it's not too much of a problem and they can find someone who is willing to take care of the patients .
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted , I thought it was pretty funny !
I don't know what that means but I'm going to upvote it anyway !
Me too ! I had to go back and look at the picture again just to be sure ...
I mean , it's not like they're the only ones who think that ...
It's not about the money , it's about sending a message !
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... It's not like he was trying to be funny or anything ..

I think it's more of a herbal tea . I don't know if that makes any sense to someone who isn't familiar with the term though .
Remember me
That's the spirit !
That's what I was thinking as well , but it doesn't seem to be an option for me at this time .

I don't think so , but I'm sure there are a lot of people who would care if they did .
That's a really good point ! I hadn't thought about it that way .

I'm not sure if you're serious or not , but that would be hilarious .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , it's true !
I'm okay with this .

Me too thanks .
Evelyne is a great name ! Thank you .

I've never seen it , but I'm going to have to check it out !
I don't think so , but I'll look into it !
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not ...
He knew about it , but he didn't want to talk about it .

I don't think he was being serious ...
That's what happens when you don't play defense .
That would be awesome , but I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon .
A little of column A , a lot of column B .
It's a reference to an episode of Spongebob where Squidward is talking about how he doesn't have any friends because they're all dead .
Haha , that's a good one ! I'll have to remember that for next time :D
His best .
He'll blame it on the lizard people !

I don't know what you're talking about but I'm pretty sure that's not how it works ...
I would love to see that , but I don't think they'd be able to pull it off without some sort of special effects or something .
I don't think I've ever seen that movie . Is it any good ?
I'll check those out , thanks !

Cecil is such a great name ! :D
I thought she was going to win at the end of last season but I guess that didn't work out so well ...

Where do you live ? And how much does it cost to live there ?
That's the spirit !
That's the spirit !
I know , right ? I can't even imagine .
I'm in the same boat as you brother !
I don't know why you're being downvoted for pointing out that it's possible to be both of those things at the same time .
I don't know , but I'm pretty sure he's going to go for it on 4th and 1 from his own 20 or something like that .

I don't think I've ever met a person who didn't know exactly what that word means .

I've seen that one , it's pretty good !
I don't know why you're being downvoted . That's pretty much the average weight of an adult male at that age .
It's pretty popular in Finland as well !
I don't know why you are getting downvoted for this ... it's a valid point !
I'm going to have to check that out , thanks !
I'm not sure what you're talking about . There were no campers in that video .
It's okay , I'm sure you're used to it by now .
I don't think you know what taste is ...
I don't think he's a bad actor , but I've never seen him in anything other than his role on House of Cards .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , this is exactly what I was going to say !
Yeah , I've been doing that for a couple of weeks now . It's worked great so far !
He didn't really show us anything though did he ? He just said we're gonna build a wall and make Mexico pay for it !
I'm sorry to hear that , hope you get a replacement !
I don't think I've ever seen a player pull that much . It's definitely possible but it doesn't happen very often .

I was thinking the same thing . It looks like he's trying to hold onto it for dear life !
He's injured .
I'd buy that for a dollar !
I don't think that's a bad idea at all , but I'm not sure how they'd pull it off ...
It's the opposite of what you're looking for but I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who would be interested in learning more about this stuff .
That's what she said ?
Sounds like my kind of party .
I've never heard of a fox before , what is it ?
I don't think that's how it works ...

It worked , thanks !
It was Khabib's camp , I believe .

I was thinking the same thing , but I'm not sure if it would be good or bad ...
I know , I'm just saying it's not the same type of character as what we have now .
I'm pretty sure that's not true , but I could be wrong .
I don't know why you're being downvoted ... this is exactly what I was going to say !
I don't know exactly , but I'd say it's about a year and a half to two years from now .
I've been doing this for years , it's so much fun !
I don't know why but this made me laugh more than it should have .
I'm aware of that , but I still think it would be cool to see him in something like this !

Don't tell me what to do ...
I don't know why but this comment made me laugh so hard :D
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not ...
Yes it is . It's been a long time since I've had to wait in line for an event though ...
I've never been to one of those but I'll have to check it out !
This is the only correct answer .
I don't know why you're being downvoted , he's a great actor and I'm glad to see him doing well in the big screen .

I don't know why you're being downvoted , that's exactly what happened .
That's what she said .
I don't think so . I'm pretty sure he'd be able to understand what was being said though .
I'd be okay with this .
I don't think you know what subjugating means ...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but I don't think there is any evidence to support that claim .
It's not as bad as some people make it out to be :P

I don't think so but if you want to try again just let me know and I'll get back to you as soon as possible .
You and me both , brother .
I think it's a combination of both , but I'm not sure .
I don't think he has 6 cars . It's probably more like 3.5 4k depending on the type of car and how much it costs to insure .

I don't know why you're being downvoted ... it's a perfectly cromulent word !
It's not like the US has ever been at war with a country before ...

You're not my supervisor !
That's the spirit !
It's because of the way it is !
If you're going to buy one , why not get both ? You'll save money in the long run !
I don't think it was planned at all , but I'm not sure what you're getting at ?
There's a difference between saying you're christian and claiming to be catholic ...

I'd buy that for a dollar !
It's the little things in life :D
He's a great player , but I don't think he should be allowed to get away with that kind of stuff .

It's the same as every other province I've ever lived in except maybe Alberta where you can only buy liquor at LCBOs
Lebron doesn't have the luxury of being able to get away with murder .

I haven't yet , but I'll keep an eye out !
Lol that was my first thought as well . Wasn't sure if it was a joke or not !
Nah , you're just a weirdo who doesn't know how to use both hands !
Lucian's Q is a skillshot , so you can't use it on the same target multiple times in a short period of time .

I'll have to try that . Thanks !

It's not about the money , it's about sending a message !
Sneezers , obviously .
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not , but it's a quote from the show ...
That's a great idea ! Good luck with your weight loss !

I'm not sure if that's a compliment or an insult .

I think she's trying to tell you something ...
You can edit your original comment if you'd like !
That's what she said .
